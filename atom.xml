An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and entering crafted input at the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the AP development shell without proper authentication, which allows for root access to the underlying Linux OS. Software versions prior to 8.3.150.0, 8.5.135.0, and 8.8.100.0 are affected.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1686" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-1686</a><br>A vulnerability in the TCP flags inspection feature for access control lists (ACLs) on Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass protection offered by a configured ACL on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of the ACL applied to an interface of an affected device when Cisco Express Forwarding load balancing using the 3-tuple hash algorithm is enabled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through an affected device that should otherwise be denied by the configured ACL. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass protection offered by a configured ACL on the affected device. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.1X46 versions above and including 12.1X46-D25 prior to 12.1X46-D71, 12.1X46-D73 on SRX Series; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D50 on SRX Series; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D75 on SRX Series.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0034" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-0034</a><br>Starting with Junos OS Release 16.1R3, the Junos Telemetry Interface supports Google gRPC remote procedure calls to provision sensors and to subscribe to and receive telemetry data. Configuration files used by gRPC were found to contain hardcoded credentials that could be used by the Junos Network Agent to perform unauthorized read of certain non-critical information (e.g. sensor data). Additionally, APIs exposed via the Juniper Extension Toolkit (JET) may be able to perform non-critical ‘set’ operations on the device. These APIs need the client to be authenticated for which the username/password can be used. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can only occur if the Junos Network Agent package (Junos Telemetry Interface) is installed on the device. If the Junos Network Agent is not installed, then the gRPC interface required to leverage these credentials is unavailable and the system is not vulnerable to this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R3-S10, 16.1R7-S4; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S10, 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R1-S8, 17.2R3-S1; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S3; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R1-S6, 17.4R2-S3; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2-S4, 18.1R3-S3; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R1-S5, 18.2R2-S1; 18.2X75 versions prior to 18.2X75-D40; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R1-S2, 18.3R1-S3.

However, the root password can be changed using “set system root-authentication plain-text-password” on systems booted from an OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance) volume, leading to a possible administrative bypass with physical access to the console. OAM volumes (e.g. flash drives) are typically instantiated as /dev/gpt/oam, or /oam for short. Password recovery, changing the root password from a console, should not have been allowed from an insecure console.

To copy files from a container, Kubernetes creates a tar inside the container, copies it over the network, and kubectl unpacks it on the user?s machine. If the tar binary in the container is malicious, it could run any code and output unexpected, malicious results. An attacker could use this to write files to any path on the user?s machine when kubectl cp is called, limited only by the system permissions of the local user. The untar function can both create and follow symbolic links.
