An attacker can create a fake camera server that listens for the client looking for a camera on the local network. When the camera responds to the client, it responds via the broadcast address, giving all information necessary to impersonate the camera. The attacker then floods the client with responses, causing the original camera to be denied service from the client, and thus causing the client to then communicate exclusively with the attacker’s fake camera server.

With a debug host processor A running in non-secure EL1 and a debug target processor B running in any privilege level, the debugging feature allows A to halt B and promote B to any privilege level. As a debug host, A has full control of B even if B owns a higher privilege level than A. Accordingly, A can read/write any EL3 memory/register via B. Also, with this memory access, A can execute arbitrary code in EL3.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-19282" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-19282</a><br>Rockwell Automation PowerFlex 525 AC Drives 5.001 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service by crashing the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) network stack. The vulnerability allows the attacker to crash the CIP in a way that it does not accept new connections, but keeps the current connections active, which can prevent legitimate users from recovering control.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-19981" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-19981</a><br>Amazon AWS SDK &lt;=2.8.5 for Android uses Android SharedPreferences to store plain text AWS STS Temporary Credentials retrieved by AWS Cognito Identity Service. An attacker can use these credentials to create authenticated and/or authorized requests. Note that the attacker must have “root” privilege access to the Android filesystem in order to exploit this vulnerability (i.e. the device has been compromised, such as disabling or bypassing Android’s fundamental security mechanisms).<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-20222" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-20222</a><br>XXE issue in Airsonic before 10.1.2 during parse.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-20229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-20229</a><br>GitLab Community and Enterprise Edition before 11.3.14, 11.4.x before 11.4.12, and 11.5.x before 11.5.5 allows Directory Traversal.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-20449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-20449</a><br>The hidma_chan_stats function in drivers/dma/qcom/hidma_dbg.c in the Linux kernel 4.14.90 allows local users to obtain sensitive address information by reading “callback=” lines in a debugfs file.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10242" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10242</a><br>Suricata version 4.0.4 incorrectly handles the parsing of the SSH banner.

The vulnerability exists because the software improperly validates user-supplied input during user authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an affected device using HTTP and supplying malicious user credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition, or to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the app user. Cisco fixed this vulnerability in the following SIP Software releases: 10.3(1)SR5 and later for Cisco Unified IP Conference Phone 8831; 11.0(4)SR3 and later for Cisco Wireless IP Phone 8821 and 8821-EX; and 12.5(1)SR1 and later for the rest of the Cisco IP Phone 7800 Series and 8800 Series.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1763" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-1763</a><br>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Software for Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization, access critical services, and cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists because the software fails to sanitize URLs before it handles requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to critical services and cause a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series products running a SIP Software release prior to 11.0(5) for Wireless IP Phone 8821 and 8821-EX; and 12.5(1)SR1 for the IP Conference Phone 8832 and the rest of the IP Phone 8800 Series. Cisco IP Conference Phone 8831 is not affected.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-1764</a><br>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Software for Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated user of the interface to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on a targeted device via a web browser and with the privileges of the user. This vulnerability affects Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series products running a SIP Software release prior to 11.0(5) for Wireless IP Phone 8821 and 8821-EX; and 12.5(1)SR1 for the IP Conference Phone 8832 and the rest of the IP Phone 8800 Series.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation and file-level permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading invalid files to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write files in arbitrary locations on the filesystem. This vulnerability affects Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series products running a SIP Software release prior to 11.0(5) for Wireless IP Phone 8821 and 8821-EX; and 12.5(1)SR1 for the IP Conference Phone 8832 and the rest of the IP Phone 8800 Series.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-1766</a><br>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Software for Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high disk utilization, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not restrict the maximum size of certain files that can be written to disk. An attacker who has valid administrator credentials for an affected system could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted, remote connection request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write a file that consumes most of the available disk space on the system, causing application functions to operate abnormally and leading to a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series products running a SIP Software release prior to 12.5(1)SR1.</p>]]></content>
