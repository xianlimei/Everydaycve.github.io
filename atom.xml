The vulnerability is due to improper controls on certain pages in the web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device with an administrator account and sending a crafted HTTP request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create additional Admin accounts with different user roles. An attacker could then use these accounts to perform actions within their scope. The attacker would need valid Admin credentials for the device. This vulnerability cannot be exploited to add a Super Admin account.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15614" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15614</a><br>A vulnerability in the one-x Portal component of IP Office could allow an authenticated user to perform stored cross site scripting attacks via fields in the Conference Scheduler Service that could affect other application users.

It was found that the PatrolCli application can allow for lateral movement and escalation of privilege inside a Windows Active Directory environment. It was found that by default the PatrolCli / PATROL Agent application only verifies if the password provided for the given username is correct; it does not verify the permissions of the user on the network. This means if you have PATROL Agent installed on a high value target (domain controller), you can use a low privileged domain user to authenticate with PatrolCli and then connect to the domain controller and run commands as SYSTEM. This means any user on a domain can escalate to domain admin through PATROL Agent. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because they believe it is adequate to prevent this escalation by means of a custom, non-default configuration.</p>]]></content>

Various rules can be configured to limit the types of updates that can be performed by a client, depending on the key used when sending the update request. Unfortunately, some rule types were not initially documented, and when documentation for them was added to the Administrator Reference Manual (ARM) in change #3112, the language that was added to the ARM at that time incorrectly described the behavior of two rule types, krb5-subdomain and ms-subdomain. This incorrect documentation could mislead operators into believing that policies they had configured were more restrictive than they actually were.

The intended (and documented) behavior is that if an operator has not specified a value for the “allow-recursion” setting, it SHOULD default to one of the following: none, if “recursion no;” is set in named.conf; a value inherited from the “allow-query-cache” or “allow-query” settings IF “recursion yes;” (the default for that setting) AND match lists are explicitly set for “allow-query-cache” or “allow-query” (see the BIND9 Administrative Reference Manual section 6.2 for more details); or the intended default of “allow-recursion {localhost; localnets;};” if “recursion yes;” is in effect and no values are explicitly set for “allow-query-cache” or “allow-query”. However, because of the regression introduced by change #4777, it is possible when “recursion yes;” is in effect and no match list values are provided for “allow-query-cache” or “allow-query” for the setting of “allow-recursion” to inherit a setting of all hosts from the “allow-query” setting default, improperly permitting recursion to all clients.

The vulnerability occurs because the configuration of the Shell Access Filter, when used with a specific type of remote authentication, can cause a system file to have unbounded writes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of remote authentication requests to the appliance when the specific configuration is applied. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to increase the size of a system log file so that it consumes most of the disk space. The lack of available disk space could lead to a DoS condition in which the device functions could operate abnormally, making the device unstable.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15460" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15460</a><br>A vulnerability in the email message filtering feature of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the CPU utilization to increase to 100 percent, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.
