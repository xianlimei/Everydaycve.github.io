It was found that the PatrolCli application can allow for lateral movement and escalation of privilege inside a Windows Active Directory environment. It was found that by default the PatrolCli / PATROL Agent application only verifies if the password provided for the given username is correct; it does not verify the permissions of the user on the network. This means if you have PATROL Agent installed on a high value target (domain controller), you can use a low privileged domain user to authenticate with PatrolCli and then connect to the domain controller and run commands as SYSTEM. This means any user on a domain can escalate to domain admin through PATROL Agent. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because they believe it is adequate to prevent this escalation by means of a custom, non-default configuration.</p>]]></content>

Hooks which make use of query4 or query6 parameters in their callouts can leak memory, resulting in the eventual exhaustion of available memory and subsequent failure of the server process. Affects Kea DHCP 1.4.0.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5740" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-5740</a><br>“deny-answer-aliases” is a little-used feature intended to help recursive server operators protect end users against DNS rebinding attacks, a potential method of circumventing the security model used by client browsers. However, a defect in this feature makes it easy, when the feature is in use, to experience an assertion failure in name.c. Affects BIND 9.7.0-&gt;9.8.8, 9.9.0-&gt;9.9.13, 9.10.0-&gt;9.10.8, 9.11.0-&gt;9.11.4, 9.12.0-&gt;9.12.2, 9.13.0-&gt;9.13.2.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5741" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-5741</a><br>To provide fine-grained controls over the ability to use Dynamic DNS (DDNS) to update records in a zone, BIND 9 provides a feature called update-policy. Various rules can be configured to limit the types of updates that can be performed by a client, depending on the key used when sending the update request. Unfortunately, some rule types were not initially documented, and when documentation for them was added to the Administrator Reference Manual (ARM) in change #3112, the language that was added to the ARM at that time incorrectly described the behavior of two rule types, krb5-subdomain and ms-subdomain. This incorrect documentation could mislead operators into believing that policies they had configured were more restrictive than they actually were. This affects BIND versions prior to BIND 9.11.5 and BIND 9.12.3.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5733" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-5733</a><br>A malicious client which is allowed to send very large amounts of traffic (billions of packets) to a DHCP server can eventually overflow a 32-bit reference counter, potentially causing dhcpd to crash. Affects ISC DHCP 4.1.0 -&gt; 4.1-ESV-R15, 4.2.0 -&gt; 4.2.8, 4.3.0 -&gt; 4.3.6, 4.4.0.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-5734</a><br>While handling a particular type of malformed packet BIND erroneously selects a SERVFAIL rcode instead of a FORMERR rcode. If the receiving view has the SERVFAIL cache feature enabled, this can trigger an assertion failure in badcache.c when the request doesn’t contain all of the expected information. Affects BIND 9.10.5-S1 to 9.10.5-S4, 9.10.6-S1, 9.10.6-S2.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5736" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-5736</a><br>An error in zone database reference counting can lead to an assertion failure if a server which is running an affected version of BIND attempts several transfers of a slave zone in quick succession. This defect could be deliberately exercised by an attacker who is permitted to cause a vulnerable server to initiate zone transfers (for example: by sending valid NOTIFY messages), causing the named process to exit after failing the assertion test. Affects BIND 9.12.0 and 9.12.1.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5737" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-5737</a><br>A problem with the implementation of the new serve-stale feature in BIND 9.12 can lead to an assertion failure in rbtdb.c, even when stale-answer-enable is off. Additionally, problematic interaction between the serve-stale feature and NSEC aggressive negative caching can in some cases cause undesirable behavior from named, such as a recursion loop or excessive logging. Deliberate exploitation of this condition could cause operational problems depending on the particular manifestation – either degradation or denial of service. Affects BIND 9.12.0 and 9.12.1.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5738" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-5738</a><br>Change #4777 (introduced in October 2017) introduced an unforeseen issue in releases which were issued after that date, affecting which clients are permitted to make recursive queries to a BIND nameserver. The intended (and documented) behavior is that if an operator has not specified a value for the “allow-recursion” setting, it SHOULD default to one of the following: none, if “recursion no;” is set in named.conf; a value inherited from the “allow-query-cache” or “allow-query” settings IF “recursion yes;” (the default for that setting) AND match lists are explicitly set for “allow-query-cache” or “allow-query” (see the BIND9 Administrative Reference Manual section 6.2 for more details); or the intended default of “allow-recursion {localhost; localnets;};” if “recursion yes;” is in effect and no values are explicitly set for “allow-query-cache” or “allow-query”. However, because of the regression introduced by change #4777, it is possible when “recursion yes;” is in effect and no match list values are provided for “allow-query-cache” or “allow-query” for the setting of “allow-recursion” to inherit a setting of all hosts from the “allow-query” setting default, improperly permitting recursion to all clients. Affects BIND 9.9.12, 9.10.7, 9.11.3, 9.12.0-&gt;9.12.1-P2, the development release 9.13.0, and also releases 9.9.12-S1, 9.10.7-S1, 9.11.3-S1, and 9.11.3-S2 from BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-3125" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-3125</a><br>Vulnerability in the Oracle Retail Merchandising System component of Oracle Retail Applications (subcomponent: Security (SQL Logger)).

A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15458" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15458</a><br>A vulnerability in the Shell Access Filter feature of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC), when used in conjunction with remote authentication, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high disk utilization, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability occurs because the configuration of the Shell Access Filter, when used with a specific type of remote authentication, can cause a system file to have unbounded writes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of remote authentication requests to the appliance when the specific configuration is applied. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to increase the size of a system log file so that it consumes most of the disk space. The lack of available disk space could lead to a DoS condition in which the device functions could operate abnormally, making the device unstable.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15460" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15460</a><br>A vulnerability in the email message filtering feature of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the CPU utilization to increase to 100 percent, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.
