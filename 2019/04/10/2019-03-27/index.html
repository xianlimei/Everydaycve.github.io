The new behaviour is to have an empty ACL file mean that all access is denied, which is not a useful configuration but is not unexpected.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12551" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-12551</a><br>When Eclipse Mosquitto version 1.0 to 1.5.5 (inclusive) is configured to use a password file for authentication, any malformed data in the password file will be treated as valid. This typically means that the malformed data becomes a username and no password. If this occurs, clients can circumvent authentication and get access to the broker by using the malformed username. In particular, a blank line will be treated as a valid empty username. Other security measures are unaffected.
