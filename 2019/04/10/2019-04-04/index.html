This may allow the user to guess values.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-18068" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-18068</a><br>The ARM-based hardware debugging feature on Raspberry Pi 3 module B+ and possibly other devices allows non-secure EL1 code to read/write any EL3 (the highest privilege level in ARMv8) memory/register via inter-processor debugging. With a debug host processor A running in non-secure EL1 and a debug target processor B running in any privilege level, the debugging feature allows A to halt B and promote B to any privilege level. As a debug host, A has full control of B even if B owns a higher privilege level than A. Accordingly, A can read/write any EL3 memory/register via B. Also, with this memory access, A can execute arbitrary code in EL3.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-19282" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-19282</a><br>Rockwell Automation PowerFlex 525 AC Drives 5.001 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service by crashing the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) network stack. The vulnerability allows the attacker to crash the CIP in a way that it does not accept new connections, but keeps the current connections active, which can prevent legitimate users from recovering control.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-19981" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-19981</a><br>Amazon AWS SDK &lt;=2.8.5 for Android uses Android SharedPreferences to store plain text AWS STS Temporary Credentials retrieved by AWS Cognito Identity Service. An attacker can use these credentials to create authenticated and/or authorized requests. Note that the attacker must have “root” privilege access to the Android filesystem in order to exploit this vulnerability (i.e. the device has been compromised, such as disabling or bypassing Android’s fundamental security mechanisms).<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-20222" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-20222</a><br>XXE issue in Airsonic before 10.1.2 during parse.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-20229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-20229</a><br>GitLab Community and Enterprise Edition before 11.3.14, 11.4.x before 11.4.12, and 11.5.x before 11.5.5 allows Directory Traversal.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-20449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-20449</a><br>The hidma_chan_stats function in drivers/dma/qcom/hidma_dbg.c in the Linux kernel 4.14.90 allows local users to obtain sensitive address information by reading “callback=” lines in a debugfs file.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10242" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10242</a><br>Suricata version 4.0.4 incorrectly handles the parsing of the SSH banner.
