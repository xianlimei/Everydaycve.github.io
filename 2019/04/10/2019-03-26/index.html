Command injection can occur in the WebHMI component.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9744" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-9744</a><br>An issue was discovered on PHOENIX CONTACT FL NAT SMCS 8TX, FL NAT SMN 8TX, FL NAT SMN 8TX-M, and FL NAT SMN 8TX-M-DMG devices. There is unauthorized access to the WEB-UI by attackers arriving from the same source IP address as an authenticated user, because this IP address is used as a session identifier.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-9764</a><br>HashiCorp Consul 1.4.3 lacks server hostname verification for agent-to-agent TLS communication. In other words, the product behaves as if verify_server_hostname were set to false, even when it is actually set to true. This is fixed in 1.4.4.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9961" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-9961</a><br>A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in ressource view in core/modules/resource/RESOURCEVIEW.php in Wikindx prior to version 5.7.0 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the id parameter.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-6540" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-6540</a><br>The Conexus telemetry protocol utilized within Medtronic MyCareLink Monitor versions 24950 and 24952, CareLink Monitor version 2490C, CareLink 2090 Programmer, Amplia CRT-D, Claria CRT-D, Compia CRT-D, Concerto CRT-D, Concerto II CRT-D, Consulta CRT-D, Evera ICD, Maximo II CRT-D and ICD, Mirro ICD, Nayamed ND ICD, Primo ICD, Protecta ICD and CRT-D, Secura ICD, Virtuoso ICD, Virtuoso II ICD, Visia AF ICD, and Viva CRT-D does not implement encryption. An attacker with adjacent short-range access to a target product can listen to communications, including the transmission of sensitive data.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-6569" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-6569</a><br>A vulnerability has been identified in Scalance X-200 (All versions), Scalance X-300 (All versions), Scalance XP/XC/XF-200 (All versions &lt;V4.1). The monitor barrier of the affected products insufficiently blocks data from being forwarded over the mirror port into the mirrored network. An attacker might use this behaviour to transmit malicious packets to systems in the mirrored network, possibly influencing their configuration and runtime behaviour. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the traffic-receiving network. Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use the vulnerability to compromise the confidentiality and availablity of the traffic-generating network. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-7167" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-7167</a><br>Zcash, before the Sapling network upgrade (2018-10-28), had a counterfeiting vulnerability. A key-generation process, during evaluation of polynomials related to a to-be-proven statement, produced certain bypass elements. Availability of these elements allowed a cheating prover to bypass a consistency check, and consequently transform the proof of one statement into an ostensibly valid proof of a different statement, thereby breaking the soundness of the proof system. This misled the original Sprout zk-SNARK verifier into accepting the correctness of a transaction.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-8987" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-8987</a><br>The application server component of TIBCO Software Inc.’s TIBCO Data Science for AWS, and TIBCO Spotfire Data Science contains a persistent cross-site scripting vulnerability that theoretically allows an authenticated user to gain access to all the capabilities of the web interface available to more privileged users.
