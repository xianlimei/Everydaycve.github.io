The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters passed to the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user of the interface to click a specific link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web-based management interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14662" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14662</a><br>It was found Ceph versions before 13.2.4 that authenticated ceph users with read only permissions could steal dm-crypt encryption keys used in ceph disk encryption.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15440" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15440</a><br>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web interface of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data that is written to log files and displayed in certain web pages of the web-based management interface of an affected device.
