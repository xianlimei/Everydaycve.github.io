Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX 5000 series, EX4300, EX4600 are: 14.1X53; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D235; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R3; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S2, 17.3R4; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S1, 17.4R3; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S1, 18.1R4; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2; 18.2X75 versions prior to 18.2X75-D30; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-0019</a><br>When BGP tracing is enabled an incoming BGP message may cause the Junos OS routing protocol daemon (rpd) process to crash and restart.

By simulating a specific BGP session restart, an attacker can repeatedly crash the RPD process causing prolonged denial of service (DoS). Graceful restart helper mode for BGP is enabled by default. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7; 16.1X65 versions prior to 16.1X65-D48; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S8; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S7, 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R1-S7, 17.2R3; 17.2X75 versions prior to 17.2X75-D92, 17.2X75-D102, 17.2X75-D110; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R2-S2, 17.3R3; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R1-S4, 17.4R2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2.

Once started, memory consumption will eventually impact any IPv4 or IPv6 request serviced by the jdhcpd daemon, thus creating a Denial of Service (DoS) condition to clients requesting and not receiving IP addresses. Additionally, some clients which were previously holding IPv6 addresses will not have their IPv6 Identity Association (IA) address and network tables agreed upon by the jdhcpd daemon after the failover event occurs, which leads to more than one interface, and multiple IP addresses, being denied on the client. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0032" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-0032</a><br>A password management issue exists where the Organization authentication username and password were stored in plaintext in log files. A locally authenticated attacker who is able to access these stored plaintext credentials can use them to login to the Organization.

Service Now versions from 15.1R1, prior to 18.1R1.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0033" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-0033</a><br>A firewall bypass vulnerability in the proxy ARP service of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to cause a high CPU condition leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). This issue affects only IPv4. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.1X46 versions above and including 12.1X46-D25 prior to 12.1X46-D71, 12.1X46-D73 on SRX Series; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D50 on SRX Series; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D75 on SRX Series.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0034" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-0034</a><br>Starting with Junos OS Release 16.1R3, the Junos Telemetry Interface supports Google gRPC remote procedure calls to provision sensors and to subscribe to and receive telemetry data. Configuration files used by gRPC were found to contain hardcoded credentials that could be used by the Junos Network Agent to perform unauthorized read of certain non-critical information (e.g. sensor data). Additionally, APIs exposed via the Juniper Extension Toolkit (JET) may be able to perform non-critical ‘set’ operations on the device. These APIs need the client to be authenticated for which the username/password can be used. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can only occur if the Junos Network Agent package (Junos Telemetry Interface) is installed on the device. If the Junos Network Agent is not installed, then the gRPC interface required to leverage these credentials is unavailable and the system is not vulnerable to this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R3-S10, 16.1R7-S4; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S10, 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R1-S8, 17.2R3-S1; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S3; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R1-S6, 17.4R2-S3; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2-S4, 18.1R3-S3; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R1-S5, 18.2R2-S1; 18.2X75 versions prior to 18.2X75-D40; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R1-S2, 18.3R1-S3.

However, the root password can be changed using “set system root-authentication plain-text-password” on systems booted from an OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance) volume, leading to a possible administrative bypass with physical access to the console. OAM volumes (e.g. flash drives) are typically instantiated as /dev/gpt/oam, or /oam for short. Password recovery, changing the root password from a console, should not have been allowed from an insecure console.

Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: All versions prior to and including 12.3; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D130, 14.1X53-D49; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1F6-S12, 15.1R7-S4; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D161, 15.1X49-D170; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D236, 15.1X53-D496, 15.1X53-D69; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7-S4, 16.1R7-S5; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S9; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R1-S8, 17.2R3-S1; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S4; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R1-S7, 17.4R2-S3; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2-S4, 18.1R3-S4; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R1-S5, 18.2R2-S1; 18.2X75 versions prior to 18.2X75-D40; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R1-S3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S1, 18.4R1-S2.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0037" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-0037</a><br>In a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) environment, the jdhcpd daemon may crash and restart upon receipt of certain DHCPv6 solicit messages received from a DHCPv6 client. By continuously sending the same crafted packet, an attacker can repeatedly crash the jdhcpd process causing a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) to both IPv4 and IPv6 clients. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1F6-S12, 15.1R7-S3; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D171, 15.1X49-D180; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D236, 15.1X53-D496; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R3-S10, 16.1R7-S4; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S8; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S10, 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R1-S8, 17.2R3-S1; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S3; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R1-S6, 17.4R2-S3; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2-S4, 18.1R3-S2; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2; 18.2X75 versions prior to 18.2X75-D30; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R1-S2.

This issue only affects the SRX340 and SRX345 services gateways. No other products or platforms are affected by this vulnerability. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D160 on SRX340/SRX345; 17.3 on SRX340/SRX345; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S3, 17.4R3 on SRX340/SRX345; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S1 on SRX340/SRX345; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2 on SRX340/SRX345; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R1-S2, 18.3R2 on SRX340/SRX345.

The high default connection limit of the REST API may allow an attacker to brute-force passwords using advanced scripting techniques. Additionally, administrators who do not enforce a strong password policy can increase the likelihood of success from brute force attacks.

External packets destined to port 111 should be dropped. Due to an information leak vulnerability, responses were being generated from the source address of the management interface (e.g. fxp0) thus disclosing internal addressing and existence of the management interface itself. A high rate of crafted packets destined to port 111 may also lead to a partial Denial of Service (DoS). Note: Systems with fxp0 disabled or unconfigured are not vulnerable to this issue. This issue only affects Junos OS releases based on FreeBSD 10 or higher (typically Junos OS 15.1+).
