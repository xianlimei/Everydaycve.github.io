Those other components will decode any URI passed to them. To protect against directory traversal the Grails Resource Plugin did the following: normalized the URI, checked the normalized URI did not step outside the appropriate root directory (e.g. the web application root), decoded the URI and checked that this did not introduce additional /../ (and similar) sequences. A bug was introduced where the Grails Resource Plugin before 1.2.13 returned the decoded version of the URI rather than the normalized version of the URI after the directory traversal check. This exposed a double decoding vulnerability. To address this issue, the Grails Resource Plugin now repeatedly decodes the URI up to three times or until decoding no longer changes the URI. If the decode limit of 3 is exceeded the URI is rejected. A side-effect of this is that the Grails Resource Plugin is unable to serve a resource that includes a ‘%’ character in the full path to the resource. Not all environments are vulnerable because of the differences in URL resolving in different servlet containers. Applications deployed to Tomcat 8 and Jetty 9 were found not not be vulnerable, however applications deployed to JBoss EAP 6.3 / JBoss AS 7.4 and JBoss AS 7.1 were found to be vulnerable (other JBoss versions weren’t tested). In certain cases JBoss returns JBoss specific vfs protocol urls from URL resolution methods (ClassLoader.getResources). The JBoss vfs URL protocol supports resolving any file on the filesystem. This made the directory traversal possible. There may be other containers, in addition to JBoss, on which this vulnerability is exposed.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2014-4024</a><br>SSL virtual servers in F5 BIG-IP systems 10.x before 10.2.4 HF9, 11.x before 11.2.1 HF12, 11.3.0 before HF10, 11.4.0 before HF8, 11.4.1 before HF5, 11.5.0 before HF5, and 11.5.1 before HF5, when used with third-party Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) accelerator cards, might allow remote attackers to have unspecified impact via a timing side-channel attack.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1171" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1171</a><br>This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Joyent SmartOS release-20170803-20170803T064301Z. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the DTrace DOF files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the host OS. Was ZDI-CAN-5106.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1195" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1195</a><br>In Cloud Controller versions prior to 1.46.0, cf-deployment versions prior to 1.3.0, and cf-release versions prior to 283, Cloud Controller accepts refresh tokens for authentication where access tokens are expected. This exposes a vulnerability where a refresh token that would otherwise be insufficient to obtain an access token, either due to lack of client credentials or revocation, would allow authentication.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1196" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1196</a><br>Spring Boot supports an embedded launch script that can be used to easily run the application as a systemd or init.d linux service. The script included with Spring Boot 1.5.9 and earlier and 2.0.0.M1 through 2.0.0.M7 is susceptible to a symlink attack which allows the “run_user” to overwrite and take ownership of any file on the same system. In order to instigate the attack, the application must be installed as a service and the “run_user” requires shell access to the server. Spring Boot application that are not installed as a service, or are not using the embedded launch script are not susceptible.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1197" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1197</a><br>In Windows Stemcells versions prior to 1200.14, apps running inside containers in Windows on Google Cloud Platform are able to access the metadata endpoint.

A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service to the users of NetWorker systems.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1221</a><br>In cf-deployment before 1.14.0 and routing-release before 0.172.0, the Cloud Foundry Gorouter mishandles WebSocket requests for AWS Application Load Balancers (ALBs) and some other HTTP-aware Load Balancers. A user with developer privileges could use this vulnerability to steal data or cause denial of service.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7422</a><br>A Local File Inclusion vulnerability in the Site Editor plugin through 1.1.1 for WordPress allows remote attackers to retrieve arbitrary files via the ajax_path parameter to editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php, aka absolute path traversal.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7445" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7445</a><br>A buffer overflow was found in the MikroTik RouterOS SMB service when processing NetBIOS session request messages. Remote attackers with access to the service can exploit this vulnerability and gain code execution on the system. The overflow occurs before authentication takes place, so it is possible for an unauthenticated remote attacker to exploit it. All architectures and all devices running RouterOS before versions 6.41.3/6.42rc27 are vulnerable.</p>
