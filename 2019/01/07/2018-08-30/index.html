<p><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10936" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10936</a><br>A weakness was found in postgresql-jdbc before version 42.2.5. It was possible to provide an SSL Factory and not check the host name if a host name verifier was not provided to the driver. This could lead to a condition where a man-in-the-middle attacker could masquerade as a trusted server by providing a certificate for the wrong host, as long as it was signed by a trusted CA.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11615" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11615</a><br>This vulnerability allows remote attackers to deny service on vulnerable installations of npm mosca 2.8.1. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the processing of topics. A crafted regular expression can cause the broker to crash. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to deny access to the target system.

User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the processing of URI handlers. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.

The SSL/TLS server certificate in the device to cloud communication was not verified by the device. As a result, an attacker in control of the network traffic of a device could have taken control of a device by intercepting and modifying commands issued from the server to the device in a Man-in-the-Middle attack. This included the ability to inject firmware update commands into the communication and cause the device to install maliciously modified firmware.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15477" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15477</a><br>myStrom WiFi Switch V1 devices before 2.66 did not sanitize a parameter received from the cloud that was used in an OS command.

The process of registering a device with a cloud account was based on an activation code derived from the device MAC address. By guessing valid MAC addresses or using MAC addresses printed on devices in shops and reverse engineering the protocol, an attacker would have been able to register previously unregistered devices to their account. When the rightful owner would have connected them after purchase to their WiFi network, the devices would not have registered with their account, would subsequently not have been controllable from the owner’s mobile app, and would not have been visible in the owner’s account. Instead, they would have been under control of the attacker.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15479</a><br>An issue was discovered in myStrom WiFi Switch V1 before 2.66, WiFi Switch V2 before 3.80, WiFi Switch EU before 3.80, WiFi Bulb before 2.58, WiFi LED Strip before 3.80, WiFi Button before 2.73, and WiFi Button Plus before 2.73. Devices did not authenticate themselves to the cloud in device to cloud communication. This lack of device authentication allowed an attacker to impersonate any device by guessing or learning their MAC address.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15480" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15480</a><br>An issue was discovered in myStrom WiFi Switch V1 before 2.66, WiFi Switch V2 before 3.80, WiFi Switch EU before 3.80, WiFi Bulb before 2.58, WiFi LED Strip before 3.80, WiFi Button before 2.73, and WiFi Button Plus before 2.73. The cloud API had a hidden parameter, which allowed an authenticated user to reconfigure the server URL for a device registered to their account. In combination with an insecure device registration vulnerability, this allowed an attacker to reconfigure a maliciously registered device to their own rogue replica of the myStrom API and issue commands to the device, including firmware update commands.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15691" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15691</a><br>Insecure deserialization of a specially crafted serialized object, in CA Release Automation 6.5 and earlier, allows attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10513" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10513</a><br>A Deserialization of Untrusted Data Privilege Escalation vulnerability in Trend Micro Security 2018 (Consumer) products could allow a local attacker to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations.
