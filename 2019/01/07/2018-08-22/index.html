An authenticated attacker could use this flaw to crash a samba server in an Active Directory Domain Controller configuration. Samba versions before 4.7.9 and 4.8.4 are vulnerable.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10919" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10919</a><br>The Samba Active Directory LDAP server was vulnerable to an information disclosure flaw because of missing access control checks. An authenticated attacker could use this flaw to extract confidential attribute values using LDAP search expressions. Samba versions before 4.6.16, 4.7.9 and 4.8.4 are vulnerable.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5235" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-5235</a><br>Norton Utilities (prior to 16.0.3.44) may be susceptible to a DLL Preloading vulnerability, which is a type of issue that can occur when an application looks to call a DLL for execution and an attacker provides a malicious DLL to use instead. Depending on how the application is configured, it will generally follow a specific search path to locate the DLL. The vulnerability can be exploited by a simple file write (or potentially an over-write) which results in a foreign DLL running under the context of the application.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5238" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-5238</a><br>Norton Power Eraser (prior to 5.3.0.24) and SymDiag (prior to 2.1.242) may be susceptible to a DLL Preloading vulnerability, which is a type of issue that can occur when an application looks to call a DLL for execution and an attacker provides a malicious DLL to use instead.

A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to read the credential and other details passed between the samba server and client.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1140" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1140</a><br>A missing input sanitization flaw was found in the implementation of LDP database used for the LDAP server. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service against a samba server, used as a Active Directory Domain Controller. All versions of Samba from 4.8.0 onwards are vulnerable<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9605" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2016-9605</a><br>A flaw was found in cobbler software component version 2.6.11-1. It suffers from an invalid parameter validation vulnerability, leading the arbitrary file reading. The flaw is triggered by navigating to a vulnerable URL via cobbler-web on a default installation.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14787" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14787</a><br>In Philips’ IntelliSpace Cardiovascular (ISCV) products (ISCV Version 2.x or prior and Xcelera Version 4.1 or prior), an attacker with escalated privileges could access folders which contain executables where authenticated users have write permissions, and could then execute arbitrary code with local administrative permissions.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14789" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14789</a><br>In Philips’ IntelliSpace Cardiovascular (ISCV) products (ISCV Version 3.1 or prior and Xcelera Version 4.1 or prior), an unquoted search path or element vulnerability has been identified, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and escalate their level of privileges.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14799" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14799</a><br>In Philips PageWriter TC10, TC20, TC30, TC50, TC70 Cardiographs, all versions prior to May 2018, the PageWriter device does not sanitize data entered by user.

The sudoers file as installed with OSP’s openstack-tripleo-common package is much too permissive. It contains several lines for the mistral user that have wildcards that allow directory traversal with ‘..’ and it grants full passwordless root access to the validations user.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-2635" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-2635</a><br>A NULL pointer deference flaw was found in the way libvirt from 2.5.0 to 3.0.0 handled empty drives.
