When decoding a group mod, it validates the group type and command after the whole group mod has been decoded. The OF1.5 decoder, however, tries to use the type and command earlier, when it might still be invalid. This causes an assertion failure (via OVS_NOT_REACHED). ovs-vswitchd does not enable support for OpenFlow 1.5 by default.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-17205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-17205</a><br>An issue was discovered in Open vSwitch (OvS) 2.7.x through 2.7.6, affecting ofproto_rule_insert__ in ofproto/ofproto.c. During bundle commit, flows that are added in a bundle are applied to ofproto in order. If a flow cannot be added (e.g., the flow action is a go-to for a group id that does not exist), OvS tries to revert back all previous flows that were successfully applied from the same bundle. This is possible since OvS maintains list of old flows that were replaced by flows from the bundle. While reinserting old flows, OvS has an assertion failure due to a check on rule state != RULE_INITIALIZED. This would work for new flows, but for an old flow the rule state is RULE_REMOVED. The assertion failure causes an OvS crash.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-17206" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-17206</a><br>An issue was discovered in Open vSwitch (OvS) 2.7.x through 2.7.6. The decode_bundle function inside lib/ofp-actions.c is affected by a buffer over-read issue during BUNDLE action decoding.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-17207" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-17207</a><br>An issue was discovered in Snap Creek Duplicator before 1.2.42. By accessing leftover installer files (installer.php and installer-backup.php), an attacker can inject PHP code into wp-config.php during the database setup step, achieving arbitrary code execution.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-17208" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-17208</a><br>Linksys Velop 1.1.2.187020 devices allow unauthenticated command injection, providing an attacker with full root access, via cgi-bin/zbtest.cgi or cgi-bin/zbtest2.cgi (scripts that can be discovered with binwalk on the firmware, but are not visible in the web interface). This occurs because shell metacharacters in the query string are mishandled by ShellExecute, as demonstrated by the zbtest.cgi?cmd=level&amp;level= substring. This can also be exploited via CSRF.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-17228" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-17228</a><br>nmap4j 1.1.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in an includeHosts call.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-17229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-17229</a><br>Exiv2::d2Data in types.cpp in Exiv2 v0.26 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) via a crafted image file.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-17230" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-17230</a><br>Exiv2::ul2Data in types.cpp in Exiv2 v0.26 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) via a crafted image file.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-17231" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-17231</a><br><strong> DISPUTED </strong> Telegram Desktop (aka tdesktop) 1.3.14 might allow attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and application exit) via an “Edit color palette” search that triggers an “index out of range” condition.
