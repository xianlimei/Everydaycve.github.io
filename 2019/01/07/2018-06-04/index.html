A specially crafted PDF document can trigger a previously freed object in memory to be reused resulting in arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user to open the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10611" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10611</a><br>Java remote method invocation (RMI) input port in GE MDS PulseNET and MDS PulseNET Enterprise version 3.2.1 and prior may be exploited to allow unauthenticated users to launch applications and support remote code execution through web services.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10613" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10613</a><br>Multiple variants of XML External Entity (XXE) attacks may be used to exfiltrate data from the host Windows platform in GE MDS PulseNET and MDS PulseNET Enterprise version 3.2.1 and prior.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10615" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10615</a><br>Directory traversal may lead to files being exfiltrated or deleted on the GE MDS PulseNET and MDS PulseNET Enterprise version 3.2.1 and prior host platform.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8390" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2016-8390</a><br>An exploitable out of bounds write vulnerability exists in the parsing of ELF Section Headers of Hopper Disassembler 3.11.20. A specially crafted ELF file can cause attacker controlled pointer arithmetic resulting in a partially controlled out of bounds write. An attacker can craft an ELF file with specific section headers to trigger this vulnerability.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9042" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2016-9042</a><br>An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the origin timestamp check functionality of ntpd 4.2.8p9. A specially crafted unauthenticated network packet can be used to reset the expected origin timestamp for target peers. Legitimate replies from targeted peers will fail the origin timestamp check (TEST2) causing the reply to be dropped and creating a denial of service condition.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1000339" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2016-1000339</a><br>In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier the primary engine class used for AES was AESFastEngine. Due to the highly table driven approach used in the algorithm it turns out that if the data channel on the CPU can be monitored the lookup table accesses are sufficient to leak information on the AES key being used. There was also a leak in AESEngine although it was substantially less. AESEngine has been modified to remove any signs of leakage (testing carried out on Intel X86-64) and is now the primary AES class for the BC JCE provider from 1.56. Use of AESFastEngine is now only recommended where otherwise deemed appropriate.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1000340" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2016-1000340</a><br>In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider versions 1.51 to 1.55, a carry propagation bug was introduced in the implementation of squaring for several raw math classes have been fixed (org.bouncycastle.math.raw.Nat???). These classes are used by our custom elliptic curve implementations (org.bouncycastle.math.ec.custom.<strong>), so there was the possibility of rare (in general usage) spurious calculations for elliptic curve scalar multiplications. Such errors would have been detected with high probability by the output validation for our scalar multipliers.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1000341" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2016-1000341</a><br>In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier DSA signature generation is vulnerable to timing attack. Where timings can be closely observed for the generation of signatures, the lack of blinding in 1.55, or earlier, may allow an attacker to gain information about the signature’s k value and ultimately the private value as well.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1000342" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2016-1000342</a><br>In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier ECDSA does not fully validate ASN.1 encoding of signature on verification. It is possible to inject extra elements in the sequence making up the signature and still have it validate, which in some cases may allow the introduction of ‘invisible’ data into a signed structure.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1000343" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2016-1000343</a><br>In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier the DSA key pair generator generates a weak private key if used with default values. If the JCA key pair generator is not explicitly initialised with DSA parameters, 1.55 and earlier generates a private value assuming a 1024 bit key size. In earlier releases this can be dealt with by explicitly passing parameters to the key pair generator.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1000344" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2016-1000344</a><br>In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier the DHIES implementation allowed the use of ECB mode.

For BC 1.55 and older, in an environment where timings can be easily observed, it is possible with enough observations to identify when the decryption is failing due to padding.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1000346" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2016-1000346</a><br>In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier the other party DH public key is not fully validated.
