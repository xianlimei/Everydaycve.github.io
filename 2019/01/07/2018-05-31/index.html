<p><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-6552" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-6552</a><br>Apport does not properly handle crashes originating from a PID namespace allowing local users to create certain files as root which an attacker could leverage to perform a denial of service via resource exhaustion, possibly gain root privileges, or escape from containers. The is_same_ns() function returns True when /proc/<global pid="">/ does not exist in order to indicate that the crash should be handled in the global namespace rather than inside of a container. However, the portion of the data/apport code that decides whether or not to forward a crash to a container does not always replace sys.argv[1] with the value stored in the host_pid variable when /proc/<global pid="">/ does not exist which results in the container pid being used in the global namespace. This flaw affects versions 2.20.8-0ubuntu4 through 2.20.9-0ubuntu7, 2.20.7-0ubuntu3.7, 2.20.7-0ubuntu3.8, 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.15 through 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.17, and 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.28.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5388" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-5388</a><br>In stroke_socket.c in strongSwan before 5.6.3, a missing packet length check could allow a buffer underflow, which may lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service while reading from the socket.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11132</a><br>In order to perform actions that require higher privileges, the Quest KACE System Management Appliance 8.0.318 relies on a message queue that runs daemonized with root privileges and only allows a set of commands to be executed.

Note that this is only an issue when <code>allRoutes</code> is set to <code>true</code> and <code>origin</code> is set to `</em><code>or left commented out in the sails CORS config file. The problem can be compounded when the cors</code>credentials<code>setting is not provided. At that point authenticated cross domain requests are possible.

sequelize is an Object-relational mapping, or a middleman to convert things from Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server into usable data for NodeJS. Before version 1.7.0-alpha3, sequelize defaulted SQLite to use MySQL backslash escaping, even though SQLite uses Postgres escaping.
[CVE-2016-10555](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-10555)
Since &quot;algorithm&quot; isn&#39;t enforced in jwt.decode()in jwt-simple 0.3.0 and earlier, a malicious user could choose what algorithm is sent sent to the server. If the server is expecting RSA but is sent HMAC-SHA with RSA&#39;s public key, the server will think the public key is actually an HMAC private key. This could be used to forge any data an attacker wants.
