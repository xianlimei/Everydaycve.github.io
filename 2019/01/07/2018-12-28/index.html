In addition, the app initiating the factory reset does not require any permissions. A factory reset will remove all user data and apps from the device. This will result in the loss of any data that have not been backed up or synced externally. The capability to perform a factory reset is not directly available to third-party apps (those that the user installs themselves with the exception of enabled Mobile Device Management (MDM) apps), although this capability can be obtained by leveraging an unprotected app component of a pre-installed platform app.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14986" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14986</a><br>The Leagoo Z5C Android device with a build fingerprint of sp7731c_1h10_32v4_bird:6.0/MRA58K/android.20170629.214736:user/release-keys contains a pre-installed app with a package name of com.android.messaging (versionCode=1000110, versionName=1.0.001, (android.20170630.092853-0)) containing an exported content provider named com.android.messaging.datamodel.MessagingContentProvider. Any app co-located on the device can read the most recent text message from each conversation. That is, for each phone number where the user has either sent or received a text message from, a zero-permission third-party app can obtain the body of the text message, phone number, name of the contact (if it exists), and a timestamp for the most recent text message of each conversation. As the querying of the vulnerable content provider app component can be performed silently in the background, a malicious app can continuously monitor the content provider to see if the current message in each conversation has changed to obtain new text messages.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14987" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14987</a><br>The MXQ TV Box 4.4.2 Android device with a build fingerprint of MBX/m201_N/m201_N:4.4.2/KOT49H/20160106:user/test-keys contains the Android framework with a package name of android (versionCode=19, versionName=4.4.2-20170213) that dynamically registers a broadcast receiver app component named com.android.server.MasterClearReceiver instead of statically registering it in the AndroidManifest.xml file of the core Android package, as done in Android Open Source Project (AOSP) code for Android 4.4.2. The dynamic-registration of the MasterClearReceiver broadcast receiver app component is not protected with the android.permission.MASTER_CLEAR permission during registration, so any app co-located on the device, even those without any permissions, can programmatically initiate a factory reset of the device. A factory reset will remove all user data and apps from the device. This will result in the loss of any data that have not been backed up or synced externally. The capability to perform a factory reset is not directly available to third-party apps (those that the user installs themselves with the exception of enabled Mobile Device Management (MDM) apps), although this capability can be obtained by leveraging an unprotected app component of core Android process.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14988" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14988</a><br>The MXQ TV Box 4.4.2 Android device with a build fingerprint of MBX/m201_N/m201_N:4.4.2/KOT49H/20160106:user/test-keys contains the Android framework with a package name of android (versionCode=19, versionName=4.4.2-20170213) that contains an exported broadcast receiver application component that, when called, will make the device inoperable. The vulnerable component named com.android.server.SystemRestoreReceiver will write a value of –restore_system\n–locale=&lt;localeto the /cache/recovery/command file and boot into recovery mode. During this process, it appears that when booting into recovery mode, the system partition gets formatted or modified and will be unable to boot properly thereafter. After the device wouldn’t boot properly, a factory reset of the device in recovery mode does not regain properly functionality of the device. The com.android.server.SystemRestoreReceiver broadcast receiver app component is accessible to any app co-located on the device and does not require any permission to access. The user can most likely recover the device by flashing clean firmware images placed on an SD card.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14992" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14992</a><br>The ASUS ZenFone 3 Max Android device with a build fingerprint of asus/US_Phone/ASUS_X008_1:7.0/NRD90M/US_Phone-14.14.1711.92-20171208:user/release-keys contains a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.asus.dm (versionCode=1510500200, versionName=1.5.0.40_171122) has an exposed interface in an exported service named com.asus.dm.installer.DMInstallerService that allows any app co-located on the device to use its capabilities to download an arbitrary app over the internet and install it. Any app on the device can send an intent with specific embedded data that will cause the com.asus.dm app to programmatically download and install the app. For the app to be downloaded and installed, certain data needs to be provided: download URL, package name, version name from the app’s AndroidManifest.xml file, and the MD5 hash of the app. Moreover, any app that is installed using this method can also be programmatically uninstalled using the same unprotected component named com.asus.dm.installer.DMInstallerService.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14995" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14995</a><br>The ZTE Blade Vantage Android device with a build fingerprint of ZTE/Z839/sweet:7.1.1/NMF26V/20180120.095344:user/release-keys, the ZTE Blade Spark Android device with a build fingerprint of ZTE/Z971/peony:7.1.1/NMF26V/20171129.143111:user/release-keys, the ZTE ZMAX Pro Android device with a build fingerprint of ZTE/P895T20/urd:6.0.1/MMB29M/20170418.114928:user/release-keys, and the ZTE ZMAX Champ Android device with a build fingerprint of ZTE/Z917VL/fortune:6.0.1/MMB29M/20170327.120922:user/release-keys contain a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.android.modem.service (versionCode=25, versionName=7.1.1; versionCode=23, versionName=6.0.1) that exports an interface to any app on co-located on the device. Using the exported interface of the com.android.modem.service app, any app can enable and obtain certain log files (modem and logcat) without the appropriate corresponding access permissions. The modem logs contain the phone number and full text body of incoming and outgoing text messages in binary format. In addition, the modem log contains the phone numbers for both incoming and outgoing phone calls. The system-wide logcat logs (those obtained via the logcat binary) tend to contain sensitive user data. Third-party apps are prevented from directly reading the system-wide logcat logs. The capability to read from the system-wide logcat logs is only available to pre-installed system apps and platform apps. The modem log and/or logcat log, once activated, get written to external storage (SD card). An app aware of this vulnerability can enable the logs, parse them for relevant data, and exfiltrate them from the device. The modem log and logcat log are inactive by default, but a third-party app with no permissions can activate them, although the app will need to be granted the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission to access them.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14998" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14998</a><br>The Leagoo P1 Android device with a build fingerprint of sp7731c_1h10_32v4_bird:6.0/MRA58K/android.20170629.214736:user/release-keys contains a hidden root privilege escalation capability to achieve command execution as the root user. They have made modifications that allow a user with physical access to the device to obtain a root shell via ADB by modifying read-only system properties at runtime.

When logging is enabled, there is a notification in the status bar, so it is not completely transparent to the user. The user can cancel the logging, but it can be re-enabled since the app with a package name of com.vivo.bsptest cannot be disabled. The writing of these logs can be initiated by an app co-located on the device, although the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is necessary to for an app to access the log files.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15002</a><br>The Vivo V7 device with a build fingerprint of vivo/1718/1718:7.1.2/N2G47H/compil11021857:user/release-keys allows any app co-located on the device to set system properties as the com.android.phone user.

On the Vivo V7 device, when the persist.sys.input.log property is set to have a value of yes, the user’s screen touches be written to the logcat log by the InputDispatcher for all apps. The system-wide logcat log can be obtained from external storage via a different known vulnerability on the device. The READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is necessary to access the log files containing the user’s touch coordinates. With some effort, the user’s touch coordinates can be mapped to key presses on a keyboard.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15004" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15004</a><br>The Coolpad Canvas device with a build fingerprint of Coolpad/cp3636a/cp3636a:7.0/NRD90M/093031423:user/release-keys contains a platform app with a package name of com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode (versionCode=24, versionName=7.0) that contains an exported service app component named com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode.MbnTestService that allows any app on the device to set certain system properties as the com.android.phone user.

Furthermore, on the Coolpad Canvas device, the com.android.phone app writes the destination phone number and body of the text message for outgoing text messages. A notification when logging can be avoided if the log is enabled after device startup and disabled prior to device shutdown by setting the system properties using the exported interface of the com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode app. Any app with the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can access the log files.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15005</a><br>The ZTE ZMAX Champ Android device with a build fingerprint of ZTE/Z917VL/fortune:6.0.1/MMB29M/20170327.120922:user/release-keys contains a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.zte.zdm.sdm (versionCode=31, versionName=V5.0.3) that contains an exported broadcast receiver app component named com.zte.zdm.VdmcBroadcastReceiver that allows any app co-located on the device to programmatically initiate a factory reset. In addition, the app initiating the factory reset does not require any permissions. A factory reset will remove all user data and apps from the device. This will result in the loss of any data that have not been backed up or synced externally. The capability to perform a factory reset is not directly available to third-party apps (those that the user installs themselves with the exception of enabled Mobile Device Management (MDM) apps), although this capability can be obtained by leveraging an unprotected app component of a pre-installed platform app.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15006" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15006</a><br>The ZTE ZMAX Champ Android device with a build fingerprint of ZTE/Z917VL/fortune:6.0.1/MMB29M/20170327.120922:user/release-keys contains a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.android.zte.hiddenmenu (versionCode=23, versionName=6.0.1) that contains an exported broadcast receiver app component named com.android.zte.hiddenmenu.CommandReceiver that is accessible to any app co-located on the device. This app component, when it receives a broadcast intent with a certain action string, will write a non-standard (i.e., not defined in Android Open Source Project (AOSP) code) command to the /cache/recovery/command file to be executed in recovery mode. Once the device boots into recovery mode, it will crash, boot into recovery mode, and crash again. This crash loop will keep repeating, which makes the device unusable. There is no way to boot into an alternate mode once the crash loop starts.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15007" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15007</a><br>The Sky Elite 6.0L+ Android device with a build fingerprint of SKY/x6069_trx_l601_sky/x6069_trx_l601_sky:6.0/MRA58K/1482897127:user/release-keys contains a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.fw.upgrade.sysoper (versionCode=238, versionName=2.3.8) that contains an exported broadcast receiver app component named com.adups.fota.sysoper.WriteCommandReceiver that allows any app co-located on the device to supply arbitrary commands to be executed as the system user. The com.fw.upgrade.sysoper app cannot be disabled by the user and the attack can be performed by a zero-permission app. Executing commands as system user can allow a third-party app to video record the user’s screen, factory reset the device, obtain the user’s notifications, read the logcat logs, inject events in the Graphical User Interface (GUI), change the default Input Method Editor (IME) (e.g., keyboard) with one contained within the attacking app that contains keylogging functionality, obtain the user’s text messages, and more.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15333" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15333</a><br>On versions 11.2.1. and greater, unrestricted Snapshot File Access allows BIG-IP system’s user with any role, including Guest Role, to have access and download previously generated and available snapshot files on the BIG-IP configuration utility such as QKView and TCPDumps.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15334" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15334</a><br>A cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the APM webtop 11.2.1 or greater may allow attacker to force an APM webtop session to log out and require re-authentication.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15335" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15335</a><br>When APM 13.0.0-13.1.x is deployed as an OAuth Resource Server, APM becomes a client application to an external OAuth authorization server.
