The vulnerability is due to incomplete bounds checks for data that is provided by the configuration and monitoring service of the affected solution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious data to the vDaemon listening service on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition on the affected device, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the device or cause the vDaemon listening service to reload and result in a DoS condition on the device. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a release of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution prior to Release 18.3.0: vBond Orchestrator Software, vEdge 100 Series Routers, vEdge 1000 Series Routers, vEdge 2000 Series Routers, vEdge 5000 Series Routers, vEdge Cloud Router Platform, vManage Network Management Software, vSmart Controller Software. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvi70003.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0343" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-0343</a><br>A vulnerability in the configuration and management service of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with vmanage user privileges or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient access restrictions to the HTTP management interface of the affected solution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTP request to the affected management service through an authenticated device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with vmanage user privileges or stop HTTP services on an affected system. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a release of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution prior to Release 18.3.0: vBond Orchestrator Software, vEdge 100 Series Routers, vEdge 1000 Series Routers, vEdge 2000 Series Routers, vEdge 5000 Series Routers, vEdge Cloud Router Platform, vManage Network Management Software, vSmart Controller Software.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of data parameters for certain fields in the affected solution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by configuring a malicious username on the login page of the affected solution. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands with vmanage user privileges on an affected system. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a release of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution prior to Release 18.3.0: vBond Orchestrator Software, vEdge 100 Series Routers, vEdge 1000 Series Routers, vEdge 2000 Series Routers, vEdge 5000 Series Routers, vEdge Cloud Router Platform, vManage Network Management Software, vSmart Controller Software.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of command arguments that are passed to the configuration and management database of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating custom functions that contain malicious code and are executed as the vmanage user of the configuration management system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the vmanage user in the configuration management system of the affected software. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a release of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution prior to Release 18.3.0: vBond Orchestrator Software, vManage Network Management Software, vSmart Controller Software. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvi69937.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0346" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-0346</a><br>A vulnerability in the Zero Touch Provisioning service of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checks for certain values in packets that are sent to the Zero Touch Provisioning service of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to the affected software for processing. When the software processes the packets, a buffer overflow condition could occur and cause an affected device to reload. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a temporary DoS condition while the device reloads. This vulnerability can be exploited only by traffic that is destined for an affected device. It cannot be exploited by traffic that is transiting a device. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a release of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution prior to Release 18.3.0: vBond Orchestrator Software, vManage Network Management Software, vSmart Controller Software.
