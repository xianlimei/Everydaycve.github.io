The Passcode feature allows authentication bypass via runtime manipulation that forces a certain method’s return value to true. In other words, an attacker could authenticate with an arbitrary passcode. NOTE: the vendor indicates that this is not an attack of interest within the context of their threat model, which excludes Android devices on which rooting has occurred.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15543" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15543</a><br><strong> DISPUTED </strong> An issue was discovered in the org.telegram.messenger application 4.8.11 for Android.
