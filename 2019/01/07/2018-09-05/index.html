It is possible to induce the application to retrieve the contents of an arbitrary external URL and return those contents in its own response. If a domain name (containing a random string) is used in the HTTP Host header, the application performs an HTTP request to the specified domain. The response from that request is then included in the application’s own response.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-9266" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2015-9266</a><br>The web management interface of Ubiquiti airMAX, airFiber, airGateway and EdgeSwitch XP (formerly TOUGHSwitch) allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload and write arbitrary files using directory traversal techniques. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges. This vulnerability is fixed in the following product versions (fixes released in July 2015, all prior versions are affected): airMAX AC 7.1.3; airMAX M (and airRouter) 5.6.2 XM/XW/TI, 5.5.11 XM/TI, and 5.5.10u2 XW; airGateway 1.1.5; airFiber AF24/AF24HD 2.2.1, AF5x 3.0.2.1, and AF5 2.2.1; airOS 4 XS2/XS5 4.0.4; and EdgeSwitch XP (formerly TOUGHSwitch) 1.3.2.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14618" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14618</a><br>curl before version 7.61.1 is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in the NTLM authentication code. The internal function Curl_ntlm_core_mk_nt_hash multiplies the length of the password by two (SUM) to figure out how large temporary storage area to allocate from the heap. The length value is then subsequently used to iterate over the password and generate output into the allocated storage buffer. On systems with a 32 bit size_t, the math to calculate SUM triggers an integer overflow when the password length exceeds 2GB (2^31 bytes). This integer overflow usually causes a very small buffer to actually get allocated instead of the intended very huge one, making the use of that buffer end up in a heap buffer overflow. (This bug is almost identical to CVE-2017-8816.)<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14769" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14769</a><br>VIVOTEK FD8177 devices before XXXXXX-VVTK-xx06a allow CSRF.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14770" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14770</a><br>VIVOTEK FD8177 devices before XXXXXX-VVTK-xx06a allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code (issue 1 of 2) via the ONVIF interface, (/onvif/device_service).<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14771" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14771</a><br>VIVOTEK FD8177 devices before XXXXXX-VVTK-xx06a allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code (issue 2 of 2) via eventscript.cgi.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15676" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15676</a><br>An issue was discovered in BTITeam XBTIT.
