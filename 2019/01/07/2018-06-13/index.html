An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by causing a node server providing an http2 server to crash. This can be accomplished by interacting with the http2 server in a manner that triggers a cleanup bug where objects are used in native code after they are no longer available. This has been addressed by updating the http2 implementation.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7162" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7162</a><br>All versions of Node.js 9.x and 10.x are vulnerable and the severity is HIGH.

Since the kernel’s proc_pid_readdir() returns PID entries in ascending numeric order, a process occupying a high PID can use inotify events to determine when the process list is being scanned, and fork/exec to obtain a lower PID, thus avoiding enumeration. An unprivileged attacker can hide a process from procps-ng’s utilities by exploiting a race condition in reading /proc/PID entries. This vulnerability affects procps and procps-ng up to version 3.3.15, newer versions might be affected also.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-12019</a><br>The signature verification routine in Enigmail before 2.0.7 interprets user ids as status/control messages and does not correctly keep track of the status of multiple signatures, which allows remote attackers to spoof arbitrary email signatures via public keys containing crafted primary user ids.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-12040</a><br><strong> DISPUTED </strong> Reflected Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the web profiler in SensioLabs Symfony 3.3.6 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the “file” parameter, aka an _profiler/open?file= URI.
