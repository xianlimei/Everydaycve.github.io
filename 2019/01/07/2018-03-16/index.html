By adding a URL path parameter with special encodings, an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. The root cause of this issue is a lack of clarity regarding the handling of path parameters in the Servlet Specification. Some Servlet containers include path parameters in the value returned for getPathInfo() and some do not. Spring Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo() as part of the process of mapping requests to security constraints. In this particular attack, different character encodings used in path parameters allows secured Spring MVC static resource URLs to be bypassed.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1200" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1200</a><br>Apps Manager for PCF (Pivotal Application Service 1.11.x before 1.11.26, 1.12.x before 1.12.14, and 2.0.x before 2.0.5) allows unprivileged remote file read in its container via specially-crafted links.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7544</a><br><strong> DISPUTED </strong> A cross-protocol scripting issue was discovered in the management interface in OpenVPN through 2.4.5. When this interface is enabled over TCP without a password, and when no other clients are connected to this interface, attackers can execute arbitrary management commands, obtain sensitive information, or cause a denial of service (SIGTERM) by triggering XMLHttpRequest actions in a web browser. This is demonstrated by a multipart/form-data POST to <a href="http://localhost:23000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://localhost:23000</a> with a “signal SIGTERM” command in a TEXTAREA element. NOTE: The vendor disputes that this is a vulnerability. They state that this is the result of improper configuration of the OpenVPN instance rather than an intrinsic vulnerability, and now more explicitly warn against such configurations in both the management-interface documentation, and with a runtime warning.</p>
