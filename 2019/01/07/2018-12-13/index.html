An attacker might include Javascript that could execute on an authenticated user’s system that could lead to website redirects, session cookie hijacking, social engineering, etc. As this is stored with the information about the node, all other authenticated users with access to this data are also vulnerable.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16555" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-16555</a><br>A vulnerability has been identified in SCALANCE S602 (All versions &lt; V4.0.1.1), SCALANCE S612 (All versions &lt; V4.0.1.1), SCALANCE S623 (All versions &lt; V4.0.1.1), SCALANCE S627-2M (All versions &lt; V4.0.1.1). The integrated web server could allow Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if unsuspecting users are tricked into accessing a malicious link. User interaction is required for a successful exploitation. The user must be logged into the web interface in order for the exploitation to succeed. At the stage of publishing this security advisory no public exploitation is known.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16556" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-16556</a><br>A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC S7-400 (incl.

Specially crafted packets sent to port 102/tcp via Ethernet interface, via PROFIBUS, or via Multi Point Interfaces (MPI) could cause the affected devices to go into defect mode. Manual reboot is required to resume normal operation. Successful exploitation requires an attacker to be able to send specially crafted packets to port 102/tcp via Ethernet interface, via PROFIBUS or Multi Point Interfaces (MPI). No user interaction and no user privileges are required to exploit the security vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow causing a Denial-of-Service condition of the core functionality of the CPU, compromising the availability of the system.
