The vulnerability is due to incorrect input validation in the web UI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTP or HTTPS packet directed to the physical management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the process to crash and possibly reload the device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected system. This vulnerability affects Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall, Firepower 9300 Security Appliance, UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects, UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb61398, CSCvb86799.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0299" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-0299</a><br>A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) feature of Cisco NX-OS on the Cisco Nexus 4000 Series Switch could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to unexpectedly reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incomplete validation of an SNMP poll request for a specific MIB. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific SNMP poll request to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg10442.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0300" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-0300</a><br>A vulnerability in the process of uploading new application images to Cisco FXOS on the Cisco Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) and Firepower 9300 Security Appliance could allow an authenticated, remote attacker using path traversal techniques to create or overwrite arbitrary files on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation during the application image upload process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating an application image containing malicious code and installing the image on the affected device using the CLI or web-based user interface (web UI). These actions occur prior to signature verification and could allow the attacker to create and execute arbitrary code with root privileges. Note: A missing or invalid signature in the application image will cause the upload process to fail, but does not prevent the exploit.

Since the page allocator does not yield CPU resources to the owner of the oom_lock mutex, a local unprivileged user can trivially lock up the system forever by wasting CPU resources from the page allocator (e.g., via concurrent page fault events) when the global OOM killer is invoked. NOTE: the software maintainer has not accepted certain proposed patches, in part because of a viewpoint that “the underlying problem is non-trivial to handle.”<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0331" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-0331</a><br>A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol (formerly known as CDP) subsystem of devices running, or based on, Cisco NX-OS Software contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to create a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly validate certain fields within a Cisco Discovery Protocol message prior to processing it. An attacker with the ability to submit a Cisco Discovery Protocol message designed to trigger the issue could cause a DoS condition on an affected device while the device restarts. This vulnerability affects Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall, Firepower 9300 Security Appliance, MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Director Switches, Nexus 1000V Series Switches, Nexus 1100 Series Cloud Services Platforms, Nexus 2000 Series Switches, Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform Switches, Nexus 3600 Platform Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Switches in NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules, UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects, UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects, UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects.
