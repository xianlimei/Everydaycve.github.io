This may allow an authorized, but not privileged local user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system. CVSS v3 base score: 8.8, CVSS vector string: (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). Rockwell Automation has released a new version of FactoryTalk Activation, Version 4.01, which addresses the identified vulnerability. Rockwell Automation recommends upgrading to the latest version of FactoryTalk Activation, Version 4.01 or later.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10992" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10992</a><br>lilypond-invoke-editor in LilyPond 2.19.80 does not validate strings before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which allows remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL, as demonstrated by a –proxy-pac-file argument, because the GNU Guile code uses the system Scheme procedure instead of the system* Scheme procedure. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-17523.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8627" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2016-8627</a><br>admin-cli before versions 3.0.0.alpha25, 2.2.1.cr2 is vulnerable to an EAP feature to download server log files that allows logs to be available via GET requests making them vulnerable to cross-origin attacks. An attacker could trigger the user’s browser to request the log files consuming enough resources that normal server functioning could be impaired.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1257" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1257</a><br>Spring Framework, versions 5.0.x prior to 5.0.6, versions 4.3.x prior to 4.3.17, and older unsupported versions allows applications to expose STOMP over WebSocket endpoints with a simple, in-memory STOMP broker through the spring-messaging module. A malicious user (or attacker) can craft a message to the broker that can lead to a regular expression, denial of service attack.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1258</a><br>Spring Framework version 5.0.5 when used in combination with any versions of Spring Security contains an authorization bypass when using method security. An unauthorized malicious user can gain unauthorized access to methods that should be restricted.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1259" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1259</a><br>Spring Data Commons, versions 1.13 prior to 1.13.12 and 2.0 prior to 2.0.7, used in combination with XMLBeam 1.4.14 or earlier versions, contains a property binder vulnerability caused by improper restriction of XML external entity references as underlying library XMLBeam does not restrict external reference expansion. An unauthenticated remote malicious user can supply specially crafted request parameters against Spring Data’s projection-based request payload binding to access arbitrary files on the system.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1260" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1260</a><br>Spring Security OAuth, versions 2.3 prior to 2.3.3, 2.2 prior to 2.2.2, 2.1 prior to 2.1.2, 2.0 prior to 2.0.15 and older unsupported versions contains a remote code execution vulnerability. A malicious user or attacker can craft an authorization request to the authorization endpoint that can lead to remote code execution when the resource owner is forwarded to the approval endpoint.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1261" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1261</a><br>Spring-integration-zip versions prior to 1.0.1 exposes an arbitrary file write vulnerability, which can be achieved using a specially crafted zip archive (affects other archives as well, bzip2, tar, xz, war, cpio, 7z) that holds path traversal filenames. So when the filename gets concatenated to the target extraction directory, the final path ends up outside of the target folder.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1278" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1278</a><br>Apps Manager included in Pivotal Application Service, versions 1.12.x prior to 1.12.22, 2.0.x prior to 2.0.13, and 2.1.x prior to 2.1.4 contains an authorization enforcement vulnerability. A member of any org is able to create invitations to any org for which the org GUID can be discovered. Accepting this invitation gives unauthorized access to view the member list, domains, quotas and other information about the org.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1280" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1280</a><br>Pivotal Greenplum Command Center versions 2.x prior to 2.5.1 contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability. An unauthenticated user can perform a SQL injection in the command center which results in disclosure of database contents.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-5150" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2009-5150</a><br>Absolute Computrace Agent V80.845 and V80.866 does not have a digital signature for the configuration block, which allows attackers to set up communication with a web site other than the intended search.namequery.com site by modifying data within a disk’s inter-partition space. This allows a privileged local user to execute arbitrary code even after that user loses access and all disk partitions are reformatted.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-5151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2009-5151</a><br>The stub component of Absolute Computrace Agent V70.785 executes code from a disk’s inter-partition space without requiring a digital signature for that code, which allows attackers to execute code on the BIOS. This allows a privileged local user to achieve persistent control of BIOS behavior, independent of later disk changes.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-5152" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2009-5152</a><br>Absolute Computrace Agent, as distributed on certain Dell Inspiron systems through 2009, has a race condition with the Dell Client Configuration Utility (DCCU), which allows privileged local users to change Computrace Agent’s activation/deactivation status to the factory default via a crafted TaskResult.xml file.</p>
