There are no restrictions on the ‘exec command’ feature of the T-Router protocol. If the command syntax is correct, there is code execution both on the other modem and on the main servers. This is fixed in production builds as of Spring 2018.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11241" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11241</a><br>An issue was discovered on SoftCase T-Router build 20112017 devices. A remote attacker can read and write to arbitrary files on the system as root, as demonstrated by code execution after writing to a crontab file. This is fixed in production builds as of Spring 2018.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-8023</a><br>Apache Mesos can be configured to require authentication to call the Executor HTTP API using JSON Web Token (JWT). In Apache Mesos versions pre-1.4.2, 1.5.0, 1.5.1, 1.6.0 the comparison of the generated HMAC value against the provided signature in the JWT implementation used is vulnerable to a timing attack because instead of a constant-time string comparison routine a standard <code>==</code> operator has been used.
