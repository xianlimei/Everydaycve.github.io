<p><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-18344" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-18344</a><br>The timer_create syscall implementation in kernel/time/posix-timers.c in the Linux kernel before 4.14.8 doesn’t properly validate the sigevent-&gt;sigev_notify field, which leads to out-of-bounds access in the show_timer function (called when /proc/$PID/timers is read). This allows userspace applications to read arbitrary kernel memory (on a kernel built with CONFIG_POSIX_TIMERS and CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE).<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-9068" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-9068</a><br>The IMM2 First Failure Data Capture function collects management module logs and diagnostic information when a hardware error is detected. This information is made available for download through an SFTP server hosted on the IMM2 management network interface. In versions earlier than 4.90 for Lenovo System x and earlier than 6.80 for IBM System x, the credentials to access the SFTP server are hard-coded and described in the IMM2 documentation, allowing an attacker with management network access to obtain the collected FFDC data. After applying the update, the IMM2 will create random SFTP credentials for use with OneCLI.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-2664" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-2664</a><br>CloudForms Management Engine (cfme) before 5.7.3 and 5.8.x before 5.8.1 lacks RBAC controls on certain methods in the rails application portion of CloudForms.

The VMX code does not restore the GDT.LIMIT to the previous host value, but instead sets it to 64KB.

The customer record transferred in cleartext contains: Client ID, Full Name, Spouse’s Full Name, Social Security Number, Spouse’s Social Security Number, Occupation, Spouse’s Occupation, Daytime Phone, Home Phone, Tax Preparer, Federal and State Taxes to File, Bank Name, Bank Account Number, and possibly other sensitive information.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14608" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14608</a><br>Thomson Reuters UltraTax CS 2017 on Windows has a password protection option; however, the level of protection might be inconsistent with some customers’ expectations because the data is directly accessible in cleartext. Specifically, it stores customer data in unique directories (%install_path%\WinCSI\UT17DATA\client_ID\file_name.XX17) that can be bypassed without authentication by examining the strings of the .XX17 file. The strings stored in the .XX17 file contain each customer’s: Full Name, Spouse’s Name, Social Security Number, Date of Birth, Occupation, Home Address, Daytime Phone Number, Home Phone Number, Spouse’s Address, Spouse’s Daytime Phone Number, Spouse’s Social Security Number, Spouse’s Home Phone Number, Spouse’s Occupation, Spouse’s Date of Birth, and Spouse’s Filing Status.</p>
