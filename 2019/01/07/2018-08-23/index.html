This can allow an attacker unauthorized access to the partitioned data of a Sentry protected table and can allow an attacker to remove data from a Sentry protected table.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-14452</a><br>An exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the PubNub message handler for the “control” channel of Insteon Hub running firmware version 1012. Specially crafted replies received from the PubNub service can cause buffer overflows on a global section overwriting arbitrary data. A strcpy overflows the buffer insteon_pubnub.channel_cc_r, which has a size of 16 bytes. An attacker can send an arbitrarily long “c_r” parameter in order to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker should impersonate PubNub and answer an HTTPS GET request to trigger this vulnerability.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14453" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-14453</a><br>On Insteon Hub 2245-222 devices with firmware version 1012, specially crafted replies received from the PubNub service can cause buffer overflows on a global section overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker should impersonate PubNub and answer an HTTPS GET request to trigger this vulnerability. A strcpy overflows the buffer insteon_pubnub.channel_ad_r, which has a size of 16 bytes.
