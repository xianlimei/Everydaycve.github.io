The observed hostnames are of the form upgr-midgress-##.htz.bitdefeder.net; however, all hostnames ending in .bitdefeder.net apparently resolve to the same IP address. This product behavior may allow remote attackers to block antivirus updates or potentially provide crafted updates, either by controlling that IP address or by purchasing the bitdefeder.net domain name.
