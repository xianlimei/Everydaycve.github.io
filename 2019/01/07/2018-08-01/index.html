In some environments, this could lead to instances created by cloning a golden master or template system, sharing ssh host keys, and being able to impersonate one another or conduct man-in-the-middle attacks.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10897" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10897</a><br>A directory traversal issue was found in reposync, a part of yum-utils, where reposync fails to sanitize paths in remote repository configuration files. If an attacker controls a repository, they may be able to copy files outside of the destination directory on the targeted system via path traversal. If reposync is running with heightened privileges on a targeted system, this flaw could potentially result in system compromise via the overwriting of critical system files. Version 1.1.31 and older are believed to be affected.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10916" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10916</a><br>It has been discovered that lftp up to and including version 4.8.3 does not properly sanitize remote file names, leading to a loss of integrity on the local system when reverse mirroring is used.
