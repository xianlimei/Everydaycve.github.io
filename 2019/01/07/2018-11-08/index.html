The vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious serialized Java object to the listening Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) service. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15393</a><br>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15394" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15394</a><br>A vulnerability in the Stealthwatch Management Console (SMC) of Cisco Stealthwatch Enterprise could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary actions with administrative privileges on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to an insecure system configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the targeted application. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthenticated access, resulting in elevated privileges in the SMC.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15437" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15437</a><br>A vulnerability in the system scanning component of Cisco Immunet and Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Endpoints running on Microsoft Windows could allow a local attacker to disable the scanning functionality of the product. This could allow executable files to be launched on the system without being analyzed for threats. The vulnerability is due to improper process resource handling. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by gaining local access to a system running Microsoft Windows and protected by Cisco Immunet or Cisco AMP for Endpoints and executing a malicious file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent the scanning services from functioning properly and ultimately prevent the system from being protected from further intrusion.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15439" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15439</a><br>A vulnerability in the Cisco Small Business Switches software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the user authentication mechanism of an affected device. The vulnerability exists because under specific circumstances, the affected software enables a privileged user account without notifying administrators of the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using this account to log in to an affected device and execute commands with full admin rights. Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. This advisory will be updated with fixed software information once fixed software becomes available. There is a workaround to address this vulnerability.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15443" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15443</a><br>A vulnerability in the detection engine of Cisco Firepower System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule that inspects certain types of TCP traffic. The vulnerability is due to incorrect TCP retransmission handling. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TCP connection request through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured IPS rules and allow uninspected traffic onto the network.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15444" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15444</a><br>A vulnerability in the web-based user interface of Cisco Energy Management Suite Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain read and write access to information that is stored on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user of an affected system to import a crafted XML file with malicious entries, which could allow the attacker to read and write files within the affected application.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15445" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15445</a><br>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Energy Management Suite Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated user of the interface to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on a targeted device via a web browser and with the privileges of the user.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15446</a><br>A vulnerability in Cisco Meeting Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information. The vulnerability is due to improper protections on data that is returned from user meeting requests when the Guest access via ID and passcode option is set to Legacy mode. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending meeting requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to determine the values of meeting room unique identifiers, possibly allowing the attacker to conduct further exploits.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15447" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15447</a><br>A vulnerability in the web framework code of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) Supervisor could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs that contain malicious SQL statements to the affected application.</p>
