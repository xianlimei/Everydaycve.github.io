This is only possible after authentication with a trusted certificate. talloc is robust against further corruption from a double-free with talloc_free() and directly calls abort(), terminating the KDC process.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16851" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-16851</a><br>Samba from version 4.0.0 and before versions 4.7.12, 4.8.7, 4.9.3 is vulnerable to a denial of service. During the processing of an LDAP search before Samba’s AD DC returns the LDAP entries to the client, the entries are cached in a single memory object with a maximum size of 256MB. When this size is reached, the Samba process providing the LDAP service will follow the NULL pointer, terminating the process. There is no further vulnerability associated with this issue, merely a denial of service.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16852" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-16852</a><br>Samba from version 4.9.0 and before version 4.9.3 is vulnerable to a NULL pointer de-reference.

With this advisory the Samba Team clarify that the MIT Kerberos build of the Samba AD DC is considered experimental. Therefore the Samba Team will not issue security patches for this configuration. Additionally, Samba 4.7.12, 4.8.7 and 4.9.3 have been issued as security releases to prevent building of the AD DC with MIT Kerberos unless –with-experimental-mit-ad-dc is specified to the configure command.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-16857</a><br>Samba from version 4.9.0 and before version 4.9.3 that have AD DC configurations watching for bad passwords (to restrict brute forcing of passwords) in a window of more than 3 minutes may not watch for bad passwords at all.

In these cases the manual testing done to confirm an organisation’s password policies apply as expected may not have been re-done after the upgrade.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-17156" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-17156</a><br>In FreeBSD before 11.2-STABLE(r340268) and 11.2-RELEASE-p5, due to incorrectly accounting for padding on 64-bit platforms, a buffer underwrite could occur when constructing an ICMP reply packet when using a non-standard value for the net.inet.icmp.quotelen sysctl.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14629" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14629</a><br>A denial of service vulnerability was discovered in Samba’s LDAP server before versions 4.7.12, 4.8.7, and 4.9.3.

This occurs because the device accepts modified QNX6 filesystem images (as long as the attacker obtains access to certain Harman decryption/encryption code) as a consequence of a bug where unsigned images pass a validity check. An attacker could potentially install persistent malicious head unit firmware and execute arbitrary code as the root user.</p>
