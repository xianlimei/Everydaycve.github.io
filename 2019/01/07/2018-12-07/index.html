A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose sensitive information or consume memory resources. IBM X-Force ID: 152855.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7063" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7063</a><br>In Aruba ClearPass, disabled API admins can still perform read/write operations. In certain circumstances, API admins in ClearPass which have been disabled may still be able to perform read/write operations on parts of the XML API. This can lead to unauthorized access to the API and complete compromise of the ClearPass instance if an attacker knows of the existence of these accounts.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7065" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7065</a><br>An authenticated SQL injection vulnerability in Aruba ClearPass Policy Manager can lead to privilege escalation. All versions of ClearPass are affected by multiple authenticated SQL injection vulnerabilities. In each case, an authenticated administrative user of any type could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to “appadmin” credentials, leading to complete cluster compromise. Resolution: Fixed in 6.7.6 and 6.6.10-hotfix.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7066" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7066</a><br>An unauthenticated remote command execution exists in Aruba ClearPass Policy Manager on linked devices. The ClearPass OnConnect feature permits administrators to link other network devices into ClearPass for the purpose of collecting enhanced information about connected endpoints. A defect in the API could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on one of the linked devices. This vulnerability is only applicable if credentials for devices have been supplied to ClearPass under Configuration -&gt; Network -&gt; Devices -&gt; CLI Settings. Resolution: Fixed in 6.7.5 and 6.6.10-hotfix.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7067" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7067</a><br>A Remote Authentication bypass in Aruba ClearPass Policy Manager leads to complete cluster compromise. An authentication flaw in all versions of ClearPass could allow an attacker to compromise the entire cluster through a specially crafted API call. Network access to the administrative web interface is required to exploit this vulnerability.

Certain administrative operations in ClearPass Guest do not properly enforce authorization rules, which allows any authenticated administrative user to execute those operations regardless of privilege level. This could allow low-privilege users to view, modify, or delete guest users. Resolution: Fixed in 6.7.6 and 6.6.10-hotfix.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7080" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7080</a><br>A vulnerability exists in the firmware of embedded BLE radios that are part of some Aruba Access points.
