<p><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7158" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7158</a><br>The <code>&#39;path&#39;</code> module in the Node.js 4.x release line contains a potential regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vector. The code in question was replaced in Node.js 6.x and later so this vulnerability only impacts all versions of Node.js 4.x. The regular expression, <code>splitPathRe</code>, used within the <code>&#39;path&#39;</code> module for the various path parsing functions, including <code>path.dirname()</code>, <code>path.extname()</code> and <code>path.parse()</code> was structured in such a way as to allow an attacker to craft a string, that when passed through one of these functions, could take a significant amount of time to evaluate, potentially leading to a full denial of service.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7159" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7159</a><br>The HTTP parser in all current versions of Node.js ignores spaces in the <code>Content-Length</code> header, allowing input such as <code>Content-Length: 1 2</code> to be interpreted as having a value of <code>12</code>. The HTTP specification does not allow for spaces in the <code>Content-Length</code> value and the Node.js HTTP parser has been brought into line on this particular difference. The security risk of this flaw to Node.js users is considered to be VERY LOW as it is difficult, and may be impossible, to craft an attack that makes use of this flaw in a way that could not already be achieved by supplying an incorrect value for <code>Content-Length</code>. Vulnerabilities may exist in user-code that make incorrect assumptions about the potential accuracy of this value compared to the actual length of the data supplied. Node.js users crafting lower-level HTTP utilities are advised to re-check the length of any input supplied after parsing is complete.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7160" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7160</a><br>The Node.js inspector, in 6.x and later is vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack which could be exploited to perform remote code execution. An attack is possible from malicious websites open in a web browser on the same computer, or another computer with network access to the computer running the Node.js process. A malicious website could use a DNS rebinding attack to trick the web browser to bypass same-origin-policy checks and to allow HTTP connections to localhost or to hosts on the local network. If a Node.js process with the debug port active is running on localhost or on a host on the local network, the malicious website could connect to it as a debugger, and get full code execution access.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7218</a><br>The AppFirewall functionality in Citrix NetScaler Application Delivery Controller and NetScaler Gateway 10.5 before Build 68.7, 11.0 before Build 71.24, 11.1 before Build 58.13, and 12.0 before Build 57.24 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5827" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-5827</a><br>In Qualcomm Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, and QRD Android with all Android releases from CAF using the Linux kernel before security patch level 2018-04-05, a buffer overflow vulnerability exists in WLAN while processing an extscan hotlist event.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8714" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-8714</a><br>Honeywell MatrikonOPC OPC Controller before 5.1.0.0 allows local users to transfer arbitrary files from a host computer and consequently obtain sensitive information via vectors related to MSXML libraries.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11099" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11099</a><br>The header::add_INFO_descriptor function in header.cpp in VCFtools 0.1.15 allows remote attackers to cause information disclosure (heap-based buffer over-read) via a crafted vcf file.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11101</a><br>Open Whisper Signal (aka Signal-Desktop) through 1.10.1 allows XSS via a resource location specified in an attribute of a SCRIPT, IFRAME, or IMG element, leading to JavaScript execution after a reply, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-10994. The attacker needs to send HTML code directly as a message, and then reply to that message to trigger this vulnerability. The Signal-Desktop software fails to sanitize specific HTML elements that can be used to inject HTML code into remote chat windows when replying to an HTML message. Specifically the IMG and IFRAME elements can be used to include remote or local resources. For example, the use of an IFRAME element enables full code execution, allowing an attacker to download/upload files, information, etc. The SCRIPT element was also found to be injectable. On the Windows operating system, the CSP fails to prevent remote inclusion of resources via the SMB protocol. In this case, remote execution of JavaScript can be achieved by referencing the script on an SMB share within an IFRAME element, for example: <iframe src="\\DESKTOP-XXXXX\Temp\test.html"> and then replying to it. The included JavaScript code is then executed automatically, without any interaction needed from the user. The vulnerability can be triggered in the Signal-Desktop client by sending a specially crafted message and then replying to it with any text or content in the reply (it doesn’t matter).<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11117</a><br>Services/Feeds/classes/class.ilExternalFeedItem.php in ILIAS 5.1.x, 5.2.x, and 5.3.x before 5.3.5 has XSS via a link attribute.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11118</a><br>The RSS subsystem in ILIAS 5.1.x, 5.2.x, and 5.3.x before 5.3.5 has XSS via a URI to Services/Feeds/classes/class.ilExternalFeedItem.php.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11119</a><br>ILIAS 5.1.x, 5.2.x, and 5.3.x before 5.3.5 redirects a logged-in user to a third-party site via the return_to_url parameter.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11120</a><br>Services/COPage/classes/class.ilPCSourceCode.php in ILIAS 5.1.x, 5.2.x, and 5.3.x before 5.3.5 has XSS.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11128" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11128</a><br>The ObjReader::ReadObj() function in ObjReader.cpp in vincent0629 PDFParser allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted pdf file.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11129" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11129</a><br>The header::add_INFO_descriptor function in header.cpp in VCFtools 0.1.15 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted vcf file.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11130" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11130</a><br>The header::add_FORMAT_descriptor function in header.cpp in VCFtools 0.1.15 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted vcf file.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11224" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11224</a><br>An issue was discovered in Libav 12.3.
