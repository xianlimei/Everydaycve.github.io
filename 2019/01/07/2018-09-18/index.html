This variable is private, yet it is readable by eth.getStorageAt function. Also, attackers can purchase a ticket at a low price by directly calling the fallback function with small msg.value, because the developer set the currency unit incorrectly. Therefore, it allows attackers to always win and get rewards.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-17111" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-17111</a><br>The onlyOwner modifier of a smart contract implementation for Coinlancer (CL), an Ethereum ERC20 token, has a potential access control vulnerability.

This can be locked down a bit by using chroot to change the root directory to protect files outside of the Karaf install directory; it can be further locked down by defining a security manager policy that limits file system access to those directories beneath the Karaf home that are necessary for the system to run. However, this still allows anyone with ssh access to the Karaf process to read and write a large number of files as the Karaf process user.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11787" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11787</a><br>In Apache Karaf version prior to 3.0.9, 4.0.9, 4.1.1, when the webconsole feature is installed in Karaf, it is available at …/system/console and requires authentication to access it. One part of the console is a Gogo shell/console that gives access to the command line console of Karaf via a Web browser, and when navigated to it is available at …/system/console/gogo. Trying to go directly to that URL does require authentication. And optional bundle that some applications use is the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard, it is part of the pax-war feature and perhaps others. When it is installed, the Gogo console becomes available at another URL …/gogo/, and that URL is not secured giving access to the Karaf console to unauthenticated users. A mitigation for the issue is to manually stop/uninstall Gogo plugin bundle that is installed with the webconsole feature, although of course this removes the console from the …/system/console application, not only from the unauthenticated endpoint. One could also stop/uninstall the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard, but other components/applications may require it and so their functionality would be reduced/compromised.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11818" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11818</a><br>In all android releases (Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, QRD Android) from CAF using the linux kernel, LUT configuration is passed down to driver from userspace via ioctl.
