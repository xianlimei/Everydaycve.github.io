<p><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7047" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7047</a><br>An issue was discovered in the MBeans Server in Wowza Streaming Engine before 4.7.1. The file system may be read and written to via JMX using the default JMX credentials (remote code execution may be possible as well).<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7048</a><br>An issue was discovered in Wowza Streaming Engine before 4.7.1. There is a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted HTTP request.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7049" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7049</a><br>An issue was discovered in Wowza Streaming Engine before 4.7.1. There is an XSS vulnerability in the HTTP providers (com.wowza.wms.http.HTTPProviderMediaList and com.wowza.wms.http.streammanager.HTTPStreamManager) causing script injection and/or reflection via a crafted HTTP request.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-6929</a><br>A jQuery cross site scripting vulnerability is present when making Ajax requests to untrusted domains. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it requires contributed or custom modules in order to exploit. For Drupal 8, this vulnerability was already fixed in Drupal 8.4.0 in the Drupal core upgrade to jQuery 3. For Drupal 7, it is fixed in the current release (Drupal 7.57) for jQuery 1.4.4 (the version that ships with Drupal 7 core) as well as for other newer versions of jQuery that might be used on the site, for example using the jQuery Update module.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6930" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-6930</a><br>In Drupal versions 8.4.x versions before 8.4.5 when using node access controls with a multilingual site, Drupal marks the untranslated version of a node as the default fallback for access queries. This fallback is used for languages that do not yet have a translated version of the created node. This can result in an access bypass vulnerability. This issue is mitigated by the fact that it only applies to sites that a) use the Content Translation module; and b) use a node access module such as Domain Access which implement hook_node_access_records().<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6931" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-6931</a><br>In Drupal versions 8.4.x versions before 8.4.5 the Settings Tray module has a vulnerability that allows users to update certain data that they do not have the permissions for. If you have implemented a Settings Tray form in contrib or a custom module, the correct access checks should be added. This release fixes the only two implementations in core, but does not harden against other such bypasses. This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the Settings Tray module.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6932" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-6932</a><br>Drupal core 7.x versions before 7.57 has an external link injection vulnerability when the language switcher block is used. A similar vulnerability exists in various custom and contributed modules. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to trick users into unwillingly navigating to an external site.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7426" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-7426</a><br>The NetIQ Identity Manager Plugins before 4.6.1 contained various XML External XML Entity (XXE) handling flaws that could be used by attackers to leak information or cause denial of service attacks.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7435" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-7435</a><br>In libzypp before 20170803 it was possible to add unsigned YUM repositories without warning to the user that could lead to man in the middle or malicious servers to inject malicious RPM packages into a users system.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7436" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-7436</a><br>In libzypp before 20170803 it was possible to retrieve unsigned packages without a warning to the user which could lead to man in the middle or malicious servers to inject malicious RPM packages into a users system.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9268" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-9268</a><br>In the open build service before 201707022 the wipetrigger and rebuild actions checked the wrong project for permissions, allowing authenticated users to cause operations on projects where they did not have permissions leading to denial of service (resource consumption).<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9269" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-9269</a><br>In libzypp before August 2018 GPG keys attached to YUM repositories were not correctly pinned, allowing malicious repository mirrors to silently downgrade to unsigned repositories with potential malicious content.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9270" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-9270</a><br>In cryptctl before version 2.0 a malicious server could send RPC requests that could overwrite files outside of the cryptctl key database.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9271" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-9271</a><br>The commandline package update tool zypper writes HTTP proxy credentials into its logfile, allowing local attackers to gain access to proxies used.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9274" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-9274</a><br>A shell command injection in the obs-service-source_validator before 0.7 could be used to execute code as the packager when checking RPM SPEC files with specific macro constructs.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-9286</a><br>The packaging of NextCloud in openSUSE used /srv/www/htdocs in an unsafe manner, which could have allowed scripts running as wwwrun user to escalate privileges to root during nextcloud package upgrade.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-18207" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-18207</a><br><strong> DISPUTED </strong> The Wave_read._read_fmt_chunk function in Lib/wave.py in Python through 3.6.4 does not ensure a nonzero channel value, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero and exception) via a crafted wav format audio file.
