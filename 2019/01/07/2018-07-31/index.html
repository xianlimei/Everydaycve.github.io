<p><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5543" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-5543</a><br>The F5 BIG-IP Controller for Kubernetes 1.0.0-1.5.0 (k8s-bigip-crtl) passes BIG-IP username and password as command line parameters, which may lead to disclosure of the credentials used by the container.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-5544</a><br>When the F5 BIG-IP APM 13.0.0-13.1.1 or 12.1.0-12.1.3 renders certain pages (pages with a logon agent or a confirm box), the BIG-IP APM may disclose configuration information such as partition and agent names via URI parameters.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17174" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-17174</a><br>Some Huawei products RSE6500 V500R002C00; SoftCo V200R003C20SPCb00; VP9660 V600R006C10; eSpace U1981 V100R001C20; V200R003C20; V200R003C30; V200R003C50 have a weak algorithm vulnerability. To exploit the vulnerability, a remote, unauthenticated attacker has to capture TLS traffic between clients and the affected products. The attacker may launch the Bleichenbacher attack on RSA key exchange to decrypt the session key and the previously captured sessions by some cryptanalytic operations. Successful exploit may cause information leak.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17707" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-17707</a><br>Due to missing authorization checks, any authenticated user is able to list, upload, or delete attachments to password safe entries in Pleasant Password Server before 7.8.3. To perform those actions on an entry, the user needs to know the corresponding “CredentialId” value, which uniquely identifies a password safe entry. Since “CredentialId” values are implemented as GUIDs, they are hard to guess. However, if for example an entry’s owner grants read-only access to a malicious user, the value gets exposed to the malicious user. The same holds true for temporary grants.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17708" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-17708</a><br>Because of insufficient authorization checks it is possible for any authenticated user to change profile data of other users in Pleasant Password Server before 7.8.3.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14533" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14533</a><br>read_tmp and write_tmp in Inteno IOPSYS allow attackers to gain privileges after writing to /tmp/etc/smb.conf because /var is a symlink to /tmp.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7934" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7934</a><br>Some Huawei mobile phone with the versions before BLA-L29 8.0.0.145(C432) have a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability because they do not adapt to specific screen gestures. An attacker may trick users into installing a malicious app. As a result, apps running on the frontend crash after the users make specific screen gestures.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7947" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7947</a><br>Huawei mobile phones with versions earlier before Emily-AL00A 8.1.0.153(C00) have an authentication bypass vulnerability. An attacker could trick the user to connect to a malicious device. In the debug mode, the malicious software in the device may exploit the vulnerability to bypass some specific function.
