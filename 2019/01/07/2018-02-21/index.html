The vulnerability is due to improper security restrictions that are imposed by the web-based service portal of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting an empty password value to an affected portal when prompted to enter an administrative password for the portal. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and gain administrator privileges for the web-based service portal of the affected software. This vulnerability affects Cisco Elastic Services Controller Software Release 3.0.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg29809.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0124" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-0124</a><br>A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass security protections, gain elevated privileges, and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is due to insecure key generation during application configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a known insecure key value to bypass security protections by sending arbitrary requests using the insecure key to a targeted application. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager releases prior to 11.5(2). Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuv67964.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0130" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-0130</a><br>A vulnerability in the use of JSON web tokens by the web-based service portal of Cisco Elastic Services Controller Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain administrative access to an affected system. The vulnerability is due to the presence of static default credentials for the web-based service portal of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by extracting the credentials from an image of the affected software and using those credentials to generate a valid administrative session token for the web-based service portal of any other installation of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain administrative access to the web-based service portal of an affected system. This vulnerability affects Cisco Elastic Services Controller Software Release 3.0.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg30884.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0139" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-0139</a><br>A vulnerability in the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) management connection interface for Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal (CVP) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the IVR connection to disconnect, creating a system-wide denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of a TCP connection request when the IVR connection is already established. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating a crafted connection to the IP address of the targeted CVP device. An exploit could allow the attacker to disconnect the IVR to CVP connection, creating a DoS condition that prevents the CVP from accepting new, incoming calls while the IVR automatically attempts to re-establish the connection to the CVP. This vulnerability affects Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal (CVP) Software Release 11.5(1).

Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within numerous exposed CGI endpoints. The vulnerability is caused by improper access controls that allow access to critical functions without authentication. An attacker can use this vulnerability to reboot affected devices, along with other actions.

An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the SMB_IOC_SVCENUM IOCTL. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length, heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the host OS.

An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the SMBIOC_TREE_RELE ioctl. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the host OS.

An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the configuration of the access controls for the installed product files. The installation procedure leaves critical files open to manipulation by any authenticated user. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges to SYSTEM.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the web-based management interface to click a link that submits malicious input to the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.

When processing a SUBSCRIBE request, the res_pjsip_pubsub module stores the accepted formats present in the Accept headers of the request. This code did not limit the number of headers it processed, despite having a fixed limit of 32. If more than 32 Accept headers were present, the code would write outside of its memory and cause a crash.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7285" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7285</a><br>A NULL pointer access issue was discovered in Asterisk 15.x through 15.2.1. The RTP support in Asterisk maintains its own registry of dynamic codecs and desired payload numbers. While an SDP negotiation may result in a codec using a different payload number, these desired ones are still stored internally. When an RTP packet was received, this registry would be consulted if the payload number was not found in the negotiated SDP. This registry was incorrectly consulted for all packets, even those which are dynamic. If the payload number resulted in a codec of a different type than the RTP stream (for example, the payload number resulted in a video codec but the stream carried audio), a crash could occur if no stream of that type had been negotiated. This was due to the code incorrectly assuming that a stream of that type would always exist.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7286" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7286</a><br>An issue was discovered in Asterisk through 13.19.1, 14.x through 14.7.5, and 15.x through 15.2.1, and Certified Asterisk through 13.18-cert2. res_pjsip allows remote authenticated users to crash Asterisk (segmentation fault) by sending a number of SIP INVITE messages on a TCP or TLS connection and then suddenly closing the connection.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7287" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7287</a><br>An issue was discovered in res_http_websocket.c in Asterisk 15.x through 15.2.1.

The software installs a privileged helper tool that runs as the root user. This privileged helper tool is installed as a LaunchDaemon and implements an XPC service. The XPC service is responsible for handling new VPN connection operations via the main PrivateVPN application. The privileged helper tool creates new VPN connections by executing the openvpn binary located in the /Applications/PrivateVPN.app/Contents/Resources directory. The openvpn binary can be overwritten by the default user, which allows an attacker that has already installed malicious software as the default user to replace the binary. When a new VPN connection is established, the privileged helper tool will launch this malicious binary, thus allowing an attacker to execute code as the root user. NOTE: the vendor has reportedly indicated that this behavior is “an acceptable part of their software.”</p>
