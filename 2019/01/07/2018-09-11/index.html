Attackers are able to download /updownload/t.report (aka Log &amp; Report) files and download backup files (via download.php) without authenticating. These backup files contain user credentials and configuration information for the camera device. An attacker is able to discover the backup filename via reading the system logs or report data, or just by brute-forcing the backup filename pattern. It may be possible to authenticate to the admin account with the admin password.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16947" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-16947</a><br>An issue was discovered in OpenAFS before 1.6.23 and 1.8.x before 1.8.2. The backup tape controller (butc) process accepts incoming RPCs but does not require (or allow for) authentication of those RPCs. Handling those RPCs results in operations being performed with administrator credentials, including dumping/restoring volume contents and manipulating the backup database. For example, an unauthenticated attacker can replace any volume’s content with arbitrary data.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16948" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-16948</a><br>An issue was discovered in OpenAFS before 1.6.23 and 1.8.x before 1.8.2. Several RPC server routines did not fully initialize their output variables before returning, leaking memory contents from both the stack and the heap. Because the OpenAFS cache manager functions as an Rx server for the AFSCB service, clients are also susceptible to information leakage. For example, RXAFSCB_TellMeAboutYourself leaks kernel memory and KAM_ListEntry leaks kaserver memory.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16949" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-16949</a><br>An issue was discovered in OpenAFS before 1.6.23 and 1.8.x before 1.8.2. Several data types used as RPC input variables were implemented as unbounded array types, limited only by the inherent 32-bit length field to 4 GB. An unauthenticated attacker could send, or claim to send, large input values and consume server resources waiting for those inputs, denying service to other valid connections.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16950" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-16950</a><br>Inteno DG400 WU7U_ELION3.11.6-170614_1328 devices allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (connectivity loss) via a series of packets with random MAC addresses, as demonstrated by macof.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16951" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-16951</a><br>xunfeng 0.2.0 allows command execution via CSRF because masscan.py mishandles backquote characters, a related issue to CVE-2018-16832.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0715" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2016-0715</a><br>Pivotal Cloud Foundry Elastic Runtime version 1.4.0 through 1.4.5, 1.5.0 through 1.5.11 and 1.6.0 through 1.6.11 is vulnerable to a remote information disclosure. It was found that original mitigation configuration instructions provided as part of CVE-2016-0708 were incomplete and could leave PHP Buildpack, Staticfile Buildpack and potentially other custom Buildpack applications vulnerable to remote information disclosure. Affected applications use automated buildpack detection, serve files directly from the root of the application and have a buildpack that matched after the Java Buildpack in the system buildpack priority when Java Buildpack versions 2.0 through 3.4 were present.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0750" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2016-0750</a><br>The hotrod java client in infinispan before 9.1.0.Final automatically deserializes bytearray message contents in certain events.
