The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by invoking the update service command with a crafted argument. An exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands with SYSTEM user privileges. While the CVSS Attack Vector metric denotes the requirement for an attacker to have local access, administrators should be aware that in Active Directory deployments, the vulnerability could be exploited remotely by leveraging the operating system remote management tools.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-18547" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-18547</a><br>Vesta Control Panel through 0.9.8-22 has XSS via the edit/web/ domain parameter, the list/backup/ backup parameter, the list/rrd/ period parameter, the list/directory/ dir_a parameter, or the filename to the list/directory/ URI.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-18548" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-18548</a><br>ajenticp (aka Ajenti Docker control panel) for Ajenti through v1.2.23.13 has XSS via a filename that is mishandled in File Manager.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-18551" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-18551</a><br>ServersCheck Monitoring Software through 14.3.3 has Persistent and Reflected XSS via the sensors.html status parameter, sensors.html type parameter, sensors.html device parameter, report.html location parameter, group_delete.html group parameter, report_save.html query parameter, sensors.html location parameter, or group_delete.html group parameter.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-18552" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-18552</a><br>ServersCheck Monitoring Software through 14.3.3 allows local users to cause a denial of service (menu functionality loss) by creating an LNK file that points to a second LNK file, if this second LNK file is associated with a Start menu.
