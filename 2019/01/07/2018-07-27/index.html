An attacker could use this flaw to conduct denial of service attacks.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-2648" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-2648</a><br>It was found that jenkins-ssh-slaves-plugin before version 1.15 did not perform host key verification, thereby enabling Man-in-the-Middle attacks.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-2649" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-2649</a><br>It was found that the Active Directory Plugin for Jenkins up to and including version 2.2 did not verify certificates of the Active Directory server, thereby enabling Man-in-the-Middle attacks.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-2650" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-2650</a><br>It was found that the use of Pipeline: Classpath Step Jenkins plugin enables a bypass of the Script Security sandbox for users with SCM commit access, as well as users with e.g. Job/Configure permission in Jenkins.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-2651" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-2651</a><br>jenkins-mailer-plugin before version 1.20 is vulnerable to an information disclosure while using the feature to send emails to a dynamically created list of users based on the changelogs. This could in some cases result in emails being sent to people who have no user account in Jenkins, and in rare cases even people who were not involved in whatever project was being built, due to some mapping based on the local-part of email addresses.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-2652" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-2652</a><br>It was found that there were no permission checks performed in the Distributed Fork plugin before and including 1.5.0 for Jenkins that provides the dist-fork CLI command beyond the basic check for Overall/Read permission, allowing anyone with that permission to run arbitrary shell commands on all connected nodes.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-2653" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-2653</a><br>A number of unused delete routes are present in CloudForms before 5.7.2.1 which can be accessed via GET requests instead of just POST requests. This could allow an attacker to bypass the protect_from_forgery XSRF protection causing the routes to be used. This attack would require additional cross-site scripting or similar attacks in order to execute.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-2658" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-2658</a><br>It was discovered that the Dashbuilder login page as used in Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite before 6.4.2 and Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization &amp; Services before 6.4.3 could be opened in an IFRAME, which made it possible to intercept and manipulate requests. An attacker could use this flaw to trick a user into performing arbitrary actions in the Console (clickjacking).<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-2663" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-2663</a><br>It was found that subscription-manager’s DBus interface before 1.19.4 let unprivileged user access the com.redhat.RHSM1.Facts.GetFacts and com.redhat.RHSM1.Config.Set methods.

If the cookie is correct, it is allowed to attach to the Xorg session. Since most memcmp() implementations return after an invalid byte is seen, this causes a time difference between a valid and invalid byte, which could allow an efficient brute force attack.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-2625" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-2625</a><br>It was discovered that libXdmcp before 1.1.2 including used weak entropy to generate session keys.

It ends up always thinking there’s valid proof, even when there is none or if the server doesn’t support the TLS extension in question. This could lead to users not detecting when a server’s certificate goes invalid or otherwise be mislead that the server is in a better shape than it is in reality. This flaw also exists in the command line tool (–cert-status).<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10862" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10862</a><br>WildFly Core before version 6.0.0.Alpha3 does not properly validate file paths in .war archives, allowing for the extraction of crafted .war archives to overwrite arbitrary files.

A privileged user/process inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process or, potentially, execute arbitrary code on the host with privileges of the QEMU process.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12148" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-12148</a><br>A flaw was found in Ansible Tower’s interface before 3.1.5 and 3.2.0 with SCM repositories. If a Tower project (SCM repository) definition does not have the ‘delete before update’ flag set, an attacker with commit access to the upstream playbook source repository could create a Trojan playbook that, when executed by Tower, modifies the checked out SCM repository to add git hooks. These git hooks could, in turn, cause arbitrary command and code execution as the user Tower runs as.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-12151</a><br>A flaw was found in the way samba client before samba 4.4.16, samba 4.5.14 and samba 4.6.8 used encryption with the max protocol set as SMB3. The connection could lose the requirement for signing and encrypting to any DFS redirects, allowing an attacker to read or alter the contents of the connection via a man-in-the-middle attack.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12165" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-12165</a><br>It was discovered that Undertow before 1.4.17, 1.3.31 and 2.0.0 processes http request headers with unusual whitespaces which can cause possible http request smuggling.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12173" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-12173</a><br>It was found that sssd’s sysdb_search_user_by_upn_res() function before 1.16.0 did not sanitize requests when querying its local cache and was vulnerable to injection.
