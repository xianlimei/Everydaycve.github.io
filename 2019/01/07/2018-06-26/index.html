In some cases, the link of the current language might contain unescaped HTML special characters. This may lead to reflective XSS via injection of arbitrary parameters and/or values on the current page URL.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12712" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-12712</a><br>An issue was discovered in Joomla! 2.5.0 through 3.8.8 before 3.8.9. The autoload code checks classnames to be valid, using the “class_exists” function in PHP. In PHP 5.3, this function validates invalid names as valid, which can result in a Local File Inclusion.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12884" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-12884</a><br>In Octopus Deploy 3.0 onwards (before 2018.6.7), an authenticated user with incorrect permissions may be able to create Accounts under the Infrastructure menu.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12889" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-12889</a><br>An issue was discovered in CCN-lite 2.0.1. There is a heap-based buffer overflow in mkAddToRelayCacheRequest and in ccnl_populate_cache for an array lacking ‘\0’ termination when reading a binary CCNx or NDN file. This can result in Heap Corruption. This was addressed by fixing the memory management in mkAddToRelayCacheRequest in ccn-lite-ctrl.c.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12895" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-12895</a><br>WordPress through 4.9.6 allows Author users to execute arbitrary code by leveraging directory traversal in the wp-admin/post.php thumb parameter, which is passed to the PHP unlink function and can delete the wp-config.php file. This is related to missing filename validation in the wp-includes/post.php wp_delete_attachment function. The attacker must have capabilities for files and posts that are normally available only to the Author, Editor, and Administrator roles. The attack methodology is to delete wp-config.php and then launch a new installation process to increase the attacker’s privileges.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12900" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-12900</a><br>Heap-based buffer overflow in the cpSeparateBufToContigBuf function in tiffcp.c in LibTIFF 4.0.9 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TIFF file.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000204" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1000204</a><br><strong> DISPUTED </strong> Linux Kernel version 3.18 to 4.16 incorrectly handles an SG_IO ioctl on /dev/sg0 with dxfer_direction=SG_DXFER_FROM_DEV and an empty 6-byte cmdp. This may lead to copying up to 1000 kernel heap pages to the userspace. This has been fixed upstream in <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/a45b599ad808c3c982fdcdc12b0b8611c2f92824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/a45b599ad808c3c982fdcdc12b0b8611c2f92824</a> already. The problem has limited scope, as users don’t usually have permissions to access SCSI devices. On the other hand, e.g. the Nero user manual suggests doing <code>chmod o+r+w /dev/sg*</code> to make the devices accessible. NOTE: third parties dispute the relevance of this report, noting that the requirement for an attacker to have both the CAP_SYS_ADMIN and CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities makes it “virtually impossible to exploit.”<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1000205</a><br>U-Boot contains a CWE-20: Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Verified boot signature validation that can result in Bypass verified boot.

An HTTP/1 style request line (i.e. method space URI space version) that declares a version of HTTP/0.9 was accepted and treated as a 0.9 request. If deployed behind an intermediary that also accepted and passed through the 0.9 version (but did not act on it), then the response sent could be interpreted by the intermediary as HTTP/1 headers.

Thus a large chunk size could be interpreted as a smaller chunk size and content sent as chunk body could be interpreted as a pipelined request. If Jetty was deployed behind an intermediary that imposed some authorization and that intermediary allowed arbitrarily large chunks to be passed on unchanged, then this flaw could be used to bypass the authorization imposed by the intermediary as the fake pipelined request would not be interpreted by the intermediary as a request.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7658" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-7658</a><br>In Eclipse Jetty Server, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all non HTTP/1.x configurations), and 9.4.x (all HTTP/1.x configurations), when presented with two content-lengths headers, Jetty ignored the second. When presented with a content-length and a chunked encoding header, the content-length was ignored (as per RFC 2616). If an intermediary decided on the shorter length, but still passed on the longer body, then body content could be interpreted by Jetty as a pipelined request.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11449</a><br>A vulnerability has been identified in SCALANCE M875 (All versions). An attacker with access to the local file system might obtain passwords for administrative users. Successful exploitation requires read access to files on the local file system. A successful attack could allow an attacker to obtain administrative passwords.
