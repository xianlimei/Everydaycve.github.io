<p><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10902" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10902</a><br>It was found that the raw midi kernel driver does not protect against concurrent access which leads to a double realloc (double free) in snd_rawmidi_input_params() and snd_rawmidi_output_status() which are part of snd_rawmidi_ioctl() handler in rawmidi.c file. A malicious local attacker could possibly use this for privilege escalation.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10932" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10932</a><br>lldptool version 1.0.1 and older can print a raw, unsanitized attacker controlled buffer when mngAddr information is displayed. This may allow an attacker to inject shell control characters into the buffer and impact the behavior of the terminal.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12115" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-12115</a><br>In all versions of Node.js prior to 6.14.4, 8.11.4 and 10.9.0 when used with UCS-2 encoding (recognized by Node.js under the names <code>&#39;ucs2&#39;</code>, <code>&#39;ucs-2&#39;</code>, <code>&#39;utf16le&#39;</code> and <code>&#39;utf-16le&#39;</code>), <code>Buffer#write()</code> can be abused to write outside of the bounds of a single <code>Buffer</code>. Writes that start from the second-to-last position of a buffer cause a miscalculation of the maximum length of the input bytes to be written.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-6557" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-6557</a><br>The MOTD update script in the base-files package in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS before 10.1ubuntu2.2, and Ubuntu 18.10 before 10.1ubuntu6 incorrectly handled temporary files.

This method is intended to be safe and only return initialized, or cleared, memory. The third argument specifying <code>encoding</code> can be passed as a number, this is misinterpreted by <code>Buffer&#39;s</code> internal “fill” method as the <code>start</code> to a fill operation. This flaw may be abused where <code>Buffer.alloc()</code> arguments are derived from user input to return uncleared memory blocks that may contain sensitive information.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17305" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-17305</a><br>Some Huawei Firewall products USG2205BSR V300R001C10SPC600; USG2220BSR V300R001C00; USG5120BSR V300R001C00; USG5150BSR V300R001C00 have a Bleichenbacher Oracle vulnerability in the IPSEC IKEv1 implementations.
