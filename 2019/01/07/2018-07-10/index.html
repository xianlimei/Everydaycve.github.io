Several areas of the SAP Internet Graphics Server (IGS) did not require sufficient input validation. Namely, the SAP Internet Graphics Server (IGS) HTTP and RFC listener, SAP Internet Graphics Server (IGS) portwatcher when registering a portwatcher to the multiplexer and the SAP Internet Graphics Server (IGS) multiplexer had insufficient input validation and thus allowing a malformed data packet to cause a crash.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-2440" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-2440</a><br>Under certain circumstances SAP Dynamic Authorization Management (DAM) by NextLabs (Java Policy Controller versions 7.7 and 8.5) exposes sensitive information in the application logs.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10861" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10861</a><br>A flaw was found in the way ceph mon handles user requests. Any authenticated ceph user having read access to ceph can delete, create ceph storage pools and corrupt snapshot images.

During the stack switch operation, processor does not deliver interrupts and exceptions, they are delivered once the first instruction after the stack switch is executed. An unprivileged system user could use this flaw to crash the system kernel resulting in DoS. This CVE-2018-10872 was assigned due to regression of CVE-2018-8897 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.10 GA kernel. No other versions are affected by this CVE.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-10726" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2016-10726</a><br>The XMLUI feature in DSpace before 3.6, 4.x before 4.5, and 5.x before 5.5 allows directory traversal via the themes/ path in an attack with two or more arbitrary characters and a colon before a pathname, as demonstrated by a themes/Reference/aa:etc/passwd URI.</p>
