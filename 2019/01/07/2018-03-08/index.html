It allows certain OS level users to execute arbitrary scripts with root level privileges.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1215</a><br>An arbitrary file upload vulnerability was discovered in vApp Manager which is embedded in Dell EMC Unisphere for VMAX, Dell EMC Solutions Enabler, Dell EMC VASA Virtual Appliances, and Dell EMC VMAX Embedded Management (eManagement): Dell EMC Unisphere for VMAX Virtual Appliance versions prior to 8.4.0.18, Dell EMC Solutions Enabler Virtual Appliance versions prior to 8.4.0.21, Dell EMC VASA Virtual Appliance versions prior to 8.4.0.514, and Dell EMC VMAX Embedded Management (eManagement) versions prior to and including 1.4 (Enginuity Release 5977.1125.1125 and earlier). A remote authenticated malicious user may potentially upload arbitrary maliciously crafted files in any location on the web server. By chaining this vulnerability with CVE-2018-1216, the attacker may use the default account to exploit this vulnerability.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1216" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1216</a><br>A hard-coded password vulnerability was discovered in vApp Manager which is embedded in Dell EMC Unisphere for VMAX, Dell EMC Solutions Enabler, Dell EMC VASA Virtual Appliances, and Dell EMC VMAX Embedded Management (eManagement): Dell EMC Unisphere for VMAX Virtual Appliance versions prior to 8.4.0.18, Dell EMC Solutions Enabler Virtual Appliance versions prior to 8.4.0.21, Dell EMC VASA Virtual Appliance versions prior to 8.4.0.514, and Dell EMC VMAX Embedded Management (eManagement) versions prior to and including 1.4 (Enginuity Release 5977.1125.1125 and earlier). They contain an undocumented default account (smc) with a hard-coded password that may be used with certain web servlets. A remote attacker with the knowledge of the hard-coded password and the message format may use vulnerable servlets to gain unauthorized access to the system. Note: This account cannot be used to log in via the web user interface.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1219" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1219</a><br>EMC RSA Archer, versions prior to 6.2.0.8, contains an improper access control vulnerability on an API which is used to enumerate user information. A remote authenticated malicious user can potentially exploit this vulnerability to gather information about the user base and may use this information in subsequent attacks.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1220" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1220</a><br>EMC RSA Archer, versions prior to 6.2.0.8, contains a redirect vulnerability in the QuickLinks feature. A remote attacker may potentially exploit this vulnerability to redirect genuine users to phishing websites with the intent of obtaining sensitive information from the users.</p>
