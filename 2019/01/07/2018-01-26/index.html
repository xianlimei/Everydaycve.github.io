<p><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-6015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-6015</a><br>An issue was discovered in the “Email Subscribers &amp; Newsletters” plugin before 3.4.8 for WordPress. Sending an HTTP POST request to a URI with /?es=export at the end, and adding option=view_all_subscribers in the body, allows downloading of a CSV data file with all subscriber data.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-6323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-6323</a><br>The elf_object_p function in elfcode.h in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, has an unsigned integer overflow because bfd_size_type multiplication is not used. A crafted ELF file allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14521" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-14521</a><br>In WonderCMS 2.3.1, the upload functionality accepts random application extensions and leads to malicious File Upload.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14522" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-14522</a><br><strong> DISPUTED </strong> In WonderCMS 2.3.1, the application’s input fields accept arbitrary user input resulting in execution of malicious JavaScript. NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue stating that this is a feature that enables only a logged in administrator to write execute JavaScript anywhere on their website.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14523" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-14523</a><br><strong> DISPUTED </strong> WonderCMS 2.3.1 is vulnerable to an HTTP Host header injection attack. It uses user-entered values to redirect pages. NOTE: the vendor reports that exploitation is unlikely because the attack can only come from a local machine or from the administrator as a self attack.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12374" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-12374</a><br>The ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation checking mechanisms during certain mail parsing operations (mbox.c operations on bounce messages). If successfully exploited, the ClamAV software could allow a variable pointing to the mail body which could cause a used after being free (use-after-free) instance which may lead to a disruption of services on an affected device to include a denial of service condition.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12375" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-12375</a><br>The ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation checking mechanisms during certain mail parsing functions (the rfc2047 function in mbox.c). An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email to the affected device. This action could cause a buffer overflow condition when ClamAV scans the malicious email, allowing the attacker to potentially cause a DoS condition on an affected device.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12376" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-12376</a><br>ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or potentially execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation checking mechanisms when handling Portable Document Format (.pdf) files sent to an affected device. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted .pdf file to an affected device. This action could cause a handle_pdfname (in pdf.c) buffer overflow when ClamAV scans the malicious file, allowing the attacker to cause a DoS condition or potentially execute arbitrary code.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12377" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-12377</a><br>ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or potentially execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation checking mechanisms in mew packet files sent to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause a heap-based buffer over-read condition in mew.c when ClamAV scans the malicious file, allowing the attacker to cause a DoS condition or potentially execute arbitrary code on the affected device.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12378" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-12378</a><br>ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation checking mechanisms of .tar (Tape Archive) files sent to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause a checksum buffer over-read condition when ClamAV scans the malicious .tar file, potentially allowing the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected device.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12379" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-12379</a><br>ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or potentially execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation checking mechanisms in the message parsing function on an affected system. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email to the affected device. This action could cause a messageAddArgument (in message.c) buffer overflow condition when ClamAV scans the malicious email, allowing the attacker to potentially cause a DoS condition or execute arbitrary code on an affected device.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-12380</a><br>ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation checking mechanisms in mbox.c during certain mail parsing functions of the ClamAV software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email to the affected device. An exploit could trigger a NULL pointer dereference condition when ClamAV scans the malicious email, which may result in a DoS condition.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2983" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2016-2983</a><br>IBM Tealeaf Customer Experience 8.7, 8.8, and 9.0.2 could allow a remote attacker under unusual circumstances to read operational data or TLS session state for any active sessions, cause denial of service, or bypass security. IBM X-Force ID: 113999.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2016-6217</a><br>Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Sophos PureMessage for UNIX before 6.3.2 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1204" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-1204</a><br>IBM Tealeaf Customer Experience 8.7, 8.8, and 9.0.2 contains hard-coded credentials.
