A remote attacker could send a carefully crafted packet to exploit a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability during tag, alarm, or event related actions such as read and write, with potential for code to be executed. If InduSoft Web Studio remote communication security was not enabled, or a password was left blank, a remote user could send a carefully crafted packet to invoke an arbitrary process, with potential for code to be executed. The code would be executed under the privileges of the InduSoft Web Studio or InTouch Edge HMI runtime and could lead to a compromise of the InduSoft Web Studio or InTouch Edge HMI server machine.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-17918" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-17918</a><br>Circontrol CirCarLife all versions prior to 4.3.1, authentication to the device can be bypassed by entering the URL of a specific page.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-17922" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-17922</a><br>Circontrol CirCarLife all versions prior to 4.3.1, the PAP credentials of the device are stored in clear text in a log file that is accessible without authentication.</p>
