<p><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11048</a><br>Dell EMC Data Protection Advisor, versions 6.2, 6,3, 6.4, 6.5 and Dell EMC Integrated Data Protection Appliance (IDPA) versions 2.0, 2.1 contain a XML External Entity (XXE) Injection vulnerability in the REST API. An authenticated remote malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability to read certain system files in the server or cause denial of service by supplying specially crafted Document Type Definitions (DTDs) in an XML request.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11063" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11063</a><br>Dell WMS versions 1.1 and prior are impacted by multiple unquoted service path vulnerabilities. Affected software installs multiple services incorrectly by specifying the paths to the service executables without quotes. This could potentially allow a low-privileged local user to execute arbitrary executables with elevated privileges.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11492" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11492</a><br>ASUS HG100 devices allow denial of service via an IPv4 packet flood.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-13341" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-13341</a><br>Crestron TSW-X60 all versions prior to 2.001.0037.001 and MC3 all versions prior to 1.502.0047.00, The passwords for special sudo accounts may be calculated using information accessible to those with regular user privileges. Attackers could decipher these passwords, which may allow them to execute hidden API calls and escape the CTP console sandbox environment with elevated privileges.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-13390" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-13390</a><br>Unauthenticated access to cloudtoken daemon on Linux via network from version 0.1.1 before version 0.1.24 allows attackers on the same subnet to gain temporary AWS credentials for the users’ roles.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14028" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14028</a><br>In WordPress 4.9.7, plugins uploaded via the admin area are not verified as being ZIP files. This allows for PHP files to be uploaded. Once a PHP file is uploaded, the plugin extraction fails, but the PHP file remains in a predictable wp-content/uploads location, allowing for an attacker to then execute the file. This represents a security risk in limited scenarios where an attacker (who does have the required capabilities for plugin uploads) cannot simply place arbitrary PHP code into a valid plugin ZIP file and upload that plugin, because a machine’s wp-content/plugins directory permissions were set up to block all new plugins.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14503" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14503</a><br>Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in intervalCheck.jsp in Coremail XT 3.0 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the sid parameter.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-6553" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-6553</a><br>The CUPS AppArmor profile incorrectly confined the dnssd backend due to use of hard links. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to escape confinement. This flaw affects versions prior to 2.2.7-1ubuntu2.1 in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, prior to 2.2.4-7ubuntu3.1 in Ubuntu 17.10, prior to 2.1.3-4ubuntu0.5 in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and prior to 1.7.2-0ubuntu1.10 in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-6556" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-6556</a><br>lxc-user-nic when asked to delete a network interface will unconditionally open a user provided path. This code path may be used by an unprivileged user to check for the existence of a path which they wouldn’t otherwise be able to reach. It may also be used to trigger side effects by causing a (read-only) open of special kernel files (ptmx, proc, sys). Affected releases are LXC: 2.0 versions above and including 2.0.9; 3.0 versions above and including 3.0.0, prior to 3.0.2.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-3110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-3110</a><br>A vulnerability was discovered in the Java VM component of Oracle Database Server. Supported versions that are affected are 11.2.0.4, 12.1.0.2, 12.2.0.1 and 18. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker having Create Session privilege with network access via Oracle Net to compromise Java VM. While the vulnerability is in Java VM, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java VM. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 9.9 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts).
