<p><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-13980" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-13980</a><br>The websites that were built from Zeta Producer Desktop CMS before 14.2.1 are vulnerable to unauthenticated file disclosure if the plugin “filebrowser” is installed, because of assets/php/filebrowser/filebrowser.main.php?file=../ directory traversal.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-13981" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-13981</a><br>The websites that were built from Zeta Producer Desktop CMS before 14.2.1 are vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code execution due to a default component that permits arbitrary upload of PHP files, because the formmailer widget blocks .php files but not .php5 or .phtml files. This is related to /assets/php/formmailer/SendEmail.php and /assets/php/formmailer/functions.php.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17541" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-17541</a><br>A Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Fortinet FortiManager 6.0.0, 5.6.4 and below versions, FortiAnalyzer 6.0.0, 5.6.4 and below versions allows inject Javascript code and HTML tags through the CN value of CA and CRL certificates via the import CA and CRL certificates feature.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0341" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-0341</a><br>A vulnerability in the web-based UI of Cisco IP Phone 6800, 7800, and 8800 Series with Multiplatform Firmware before 11.2(1) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a command injection and execute commands with the privileges of the web server. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including arbitrary shell commands in a specific user input field. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvi51426.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7468" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-7468</a><br>In curl and libcurl 7.52.0 to and including 7.53.1, libcurl would attempt to resume a TLS session even if the client certificate had changed. That is unacceptable since a server by specification is allowed to skip the client certificate check on resume, and may instead use the old identity which was established by the previous certificate (or no certificate). libcurl supports by default the use of TLS session id/ticket to resume previous TLS sessions to speed up subsequent TLS handshakes. They are used when for any reason an existing TLS connection couldn’t be kept alive to make the next handshake faster. This flaw is a regression and identical to CVE-2016-5419 reported on August 3rd 2016, but affecting a different version range.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0383" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-0383</a><br>A vulnerability in the detection engine of Cisco FireSIGHT System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a file policy that is configured to block the transfer of files to an affected system via FTP. The vulnerability exists because the affected software incorrectly handles FTP control connections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted FTP connection to transfer a file to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a file policy that is configured to apply the Block upload with reset action to FTP traffic. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh70130.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0384" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-0384</a><br>A vulnerability in the detection engine of Cisco FireSIGHT System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a URL-based access control policy that is configured to block traffic for an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software incorrectly handles TCP packets that are received out of order when a TCP SYN retransmission is issued. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted connection through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a URL-based access control policy that is configured to block traffic for the affected system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh84511.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0385" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-0385</a><br>A vulnerability in the detection engine parsing of Security Socket Layer (SSL) protocol packets for Cisco Firepower System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to the Snort process unexpectedly restarting. The vulnerability is due to improper input handling of the SSL traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SSL traffic to the detection engine on the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition if the Snort process restarts and traffic inspection is bypassed or traffic is dropped.

In the dnsreplay tool provided with PowerDNS Authoritative, replaying a specially crafted PCAP file can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, leading to a crash and potentially arbitrary code execution. This buffer overflow only occurs when the -ecs-stamp option of dnsreplay is used.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11716" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11716</a><br>An issue was discovered in Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central before 100230.
