This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session. IBM X-Force ID: 137448.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10361</a><br>An issue was discovered in KTextEditor 5.34.0 through 5.45.0. Insecure handling of temporary files in the KTextEditor’s kauth_ktexteditor_helper service (as utilized in the Kate text editor) can allow other unprivileged users on the local system to gain root privileges. The attack occurs when one user (who has an unprivileged account but is also able to authenticate as root) writes a text file using Kate into a directory owned by a another unprivileged user. The latter unprivileged user conducts a symlink attack to achieve privilege escalation.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10362" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10362</a><br>An issue was discovered in phpLiteAdmin 1.9.5 through 1.9.7.1. Due to loose comparison with ‘==’ instead of ‘===’ in classes/Authorization.php for the user-provided login password, it is possible to login with a simpler password if the password has the form of a power in scientific notation (like ‘2e2’ for ‘200’ or ‘0e1234’ for ‘0’). This is possible because, in the loose comparison case, PHP interprets the string as a number in scientific notation, and thus converts it to a number. After that, the comparison with ‘==’ casts the user input (e.g., the string ‘200’ or ‘0’) to a number, too. Hence the attacker can login with just a ‘0’ or a simple number he has to brute force. Strong comparison with ‘===’ prevents the cast into numbers.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10366" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10366</a><br>An issue was discovered in the Users (aka Front-end user management) plugin 1.4.5 for October CMS.
