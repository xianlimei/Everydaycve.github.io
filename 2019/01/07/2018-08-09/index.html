<p><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10908" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10908</a><br>It was found that vdsm before version 4.20.37 invokes qemu-img on untrusted inputs without limiting resources. By uploading a specially crafted image, an attacker could cause the qemu-img process to consume unbounded amounts of memory of CPU time, causing a denial of service condition that could potentially impact other users of the host.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10915" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10915</a><br>A vulnerability was found in libpq, the default PostgreSQL client library where libpq failed to properly reset its internal state between connections. If an affected version of libpq was used with “host” or “hostaddr” connection parameters from untrusted input, attackers could bypass client-side connection security features, obtain access to higher privileged connections or potentially cause other impact through SQL injection, by causing the PQescape() functions to malfunction. Postgresql versions before 10.5, 9.6.10, 9.5.14, 9.4.19, and 9.3.24 are affected.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10925" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10925</a><br>It was discovered that PostgreSQL versions before 10.5, 9.6.10, 9.5.14, 9.4.19, and 9.3.24 failed to properly check authorization on certain statements involved with “INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE”. An attacker with “CREATE TABLE” privileges could exploit this to read arbitrary bytes server memory. If the attacker also had certain “INSERT” and limited “UPDATE” privileges to a particular table, they could exploit this to update other columns in the same table.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10931" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10931</a><br>It was found that cobbler 2.6.x exposed all functions from its CobblerXMLRPCInterface class over XMLRPC. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to gain high privileges within cobbler, upload files to arbitrary location in the context of the daemon.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15133" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15133</a><br>In Laravel Framework through 5.5.40 and 5.6.x through 5.6.29, remote code execution might occur as a result of an unserialize call on a potentially untrusted X-XSRF-TOKEN value. This involves the decrypt method in Illuminate/Encryption/Encrypter.php and PendingBroadcast in gadgetchains/Laravel/RCE/3/chain.php in phpggc. The attacker must know the application key, which normally would never occur, but could happen if the attacker previously had privileged access or successfully accomplished a previous attack.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-6922" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-6922</a><br>One of the data structures that holds TCP segments in all versions of FreeBSD prior to 11.2-RELEASE-p1, 11.1-RELEASE-p12, and 10.4-RELEASE-p10 uses an inefficient algorithm to reassemble the data. This causes the CPU time spent on segment processing to grow linearly with the number of segments in the reassembly queue. An attacker who has the ability to send TCP traffic to a victim system can degrade the victim system’s network performance and/or consume excessive CPU by exploiting the inefficiency of TCP reassembly handling, with relatively small bandwidth cost.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0429" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-0429</a><br>Stack-based buffer overflow in the Cisco Thor decoder before commit 18de8f9f0762c3a542b1122589edb8af859d9813 allows local users to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) and execute arbitrary code via a crafted non-conformant Thor bitstream.</p>
