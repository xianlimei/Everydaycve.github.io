ThreatMetrix is a security library for mobile applications, which aims to provide fraud prevention and device identity capabilities. The ThreatMetrix SDK versions prior to 3.2 do not validate SSL certificates on the iOS platform. An affected application will communicate with <a href="https://h-sdk.online-metrix.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://h-sdk.online-metrix.net</a>, regardless of whether the connection is secure or not. An attacker on the same network as or upstream from the iOS device may be able to view or modify ThreatMetrix network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3183" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-3183</a><br>Sage XRT Treasury, version 3, fails to properly restrict database access to authorized users, which may enable any authenticated user to gain full access to privileged database functions. Sage XRT Treasury is a business finance management application. Database user access privileges are determined by the USER_CODE field associated with the querying user. By modifying the USER_CODE value to match that of a privileged user, a low-privileged, authenticated user may gain privileged access to the SQL database. A remote, authenticated user can submit specially crafted SQL queries to gain privileged access to the application database.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3187" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-3187</a><br>The dotCMS administration panel, versions 3.7.1 and earlier, are vulnerable to cross-site request forgery. The dotCMS administrator panel contains a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. An attacker can perform actions with the same permissions as a victim user, provided the victim has an active session and is induced to trigger the malicious request. An unauthenticated remote attacker may perform actions with the dotCMS administrator panel with the same permissions of a victim user or execute arbitrary system commands with the permissions of the user running the dotCMS application.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3188" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-3188</a><br>The dotCMS administration panel, versions 3.7.1 and earlier, “Push Publishing” feature in Enterprise Pro is vulnerable to path traversal. When “Bundle” tar.gz archives uploaded to the Push Publishing feature are decompressed, the filenames of its contents are not properly checked, allowing for writing files to arbitrary directories on the file system. These archives may be uploaded directly via the administrator panel, or using the CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2017-3187). An unauthenticated remote attacker may perform actions with the dotCMS administrator panel with the same permissions of a victim user or execute arbitrary system commands with the permissions of the user running the dotCMS application.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3189" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-3189</a><br>The dotCMS administration panel, versions 3.7.1 and earlier, “Push Publishing” feature in Enterprise Pro is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload. When “Bundle” tar.gz archives uploaded to the Push Publishing feature are decompressed, there are no checks on the types of files which the bundle contains. This vulnerability combined with the path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2017-3188) can lead to remote command execution with the permissions of the user running the dotCMS application. An unauthenticated remote attacker may perform actions with the dotCMS administrator panel with the same permissions of a victim user or execute arbitrary system commands with the permissions of the user running the dotCMS application.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3209" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-3209</a><br>The DBPOWER U818A WIFI quadcopter drone provides FTP access over its own local access point, and allows full file permissions to the anonymous user. The DBPower U818A WIFI quadcopter drone runs an FTP server that by default allows anonymous access without a password, and provides full filesystem read/write permissions to the anonymous user. A remote user within range of the open access point on the drone may utilize the anonymous user of the FTP server to read arbitrary files, such as images and video recorded by the device, or to replace system files such as /etc/shadow to gain further access to the device. Furthermore, the DBPOWER U818A WIFI quadcopter drone uses BusyBox 1.20.2, which was released in 2012, and may be vulnerable to other known BusyBox vulnerabilities.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3210" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-3210</a><br>Applications developed using the Portrait Display SDK, versions 2.30 through 2.34, default to insecure configurations which allow arbitrary code execution. A number of applications developed using the Portrait Displays SDK do not use secure permissions when running. These applications run the component pdiservice.exe with NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM permissions. This component is also read/writable by all Authenticated Users. This allows local authenticated attackers to run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. The following applications have been identified by Portrait Displays as affected: Fujitsu DisplayView Click: Version 6.0 and 6.01. The issue was fixed in Version 6.3. Fujitsu DisplayView Click Suite: Version 5. The issue is addressed by patch in Version 5.9. HP Display Assistant: Version 2.1. The issue was fixed in Version 2.11. HP My Display: Version 2.0. The issue was fixed in Version 2.1. Philips Smart Control Premium: Versions 2.23, 2.25. The issue was fixed in Version 2.26.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-3217</a><br>CalAmp LMU 3030 series OBD-II CDMA and GSM devices has an SMS (text message) interface that can be deployed where no password is configured for this interface by the integrator / reseller. This interface must be password protected, otherwise, the attacker only needs to know the phone number of the device (via an IMSI Catcher, for example) to send administrative commands to the device. These commands can be used to provide ongoing, real-time access to the device and can configure parameters such as IP addresses, firewall rules, and passwords.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3223" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-3223</a><br>Dahua IP camera products using firmware versions prior to V2.400.0000.14.R.20170713 include a version of the Sonia web interface that may be vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow. Dahua IP camera products include an application known as Sonia (/usr/bin/sonia) that provides the web interface and other services for controlling the IP camera remotely. Versions of Sonia included in firmware versions prior to DH_IPC-Consumer-Zi-Themis_Eng_P_V2.408.0000.11.R.20170621 do not validate input data length for the ‘password’ field of the web interface. A remote, unauthenticated attacker may submit a crafted POST request to the IP camera’s Sonia web interface that may lead to out-of-bounds memory operations and loss of availability or remote code execution. The issue was originally identified by the researcher in firmware version DH_IPC-HX1X2X-Themis_EngSpnFrn_N_V2.400.0000.30.R.20160803.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3224" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-3224</a><br>Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol implementations may improperly determine Link State Advertisement (LSA) recency for LSAs with MaxSequenceNumber. According to RFC 2328 section 13.1, for two instances of the same LSA, recency is determined by first comparing sequence numbers, then checksums, and finally MaxAge. In a case where the sequence numbers are the same, the LSA with the larger checksum is considered more recent, and will not be flushed from the Link State Database (LSDB). Since the RFC does not explicitly state that the values of links carried by a LSA must be the same when prematurely aging a self-originating LSA with MaxSequenceNumber, it is possible in vulnerable OSPF implementations for an attacker to craft a LSA with MaxSequenceNumber and invalid links that will result in a larger checksum and thus a ‘newer’ LSA that will not be flushed from the LSDB. Propagation of the crafted LSA can result in the erasure or alteration of the routing tables of routers within the routing domain, creating a denial of service condition or the re-routing of traffic on the network. CVE-2017-3224 has been reserved for Quagga and downstream implementations (SUSE, openSUSE, and Red Hat packages).<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3225" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-3225</a><br>Das U-Boot is a device bootloader that can read its configuration from an AES encrypted file. For devices utilizing this environment encryption mode, U-Boot’s use of a zero initialization vector may allow attacks against the underlying cryptographic implementation and allow an attacker to decrypt the data. Das U-Boot’s AES-CBC encryption feature uses a zero (0) initialization vector. This allows an attacker to perform dictionary attacks on encrypted data produced by Das U-Boot to learn information about the encrypted data.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3226" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-3226</a><br>Das U-Boot is a device bootloader that can read its configuration from an AES encrypted file. Devices that make use of Das U-Boot’s AES-CBC encryption feature using environment encryption (i.e., setting the configuration parameter CONFIG_ENV_AES=y) read environment variables from disk as the encrypted disk image is processed. An attacker with physical access to the device can manipulate the encrypted environment data to include a crafted two-byte sequence which triggers an error in environment variable parsing. This error condition is improperly handled by Das U-Boot, resulting in an immediate process termination with a debugging message.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10905" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10905</a><br>CloudForms Management Engine (cfme) is vulnerable to an improper security setting in the dRuby component of CloudForms. An attacker with access to an unprivileged local shell could use this flaw to execute commands as a high privileged user.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10906" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-10906</a><br>In fuse before versions 2.9.8 and 3.x before 3.2.5, fusermount is vulnerable to a restriction bypass when SELinux is active. This allows non-root users to mount a FUSE file system with the ‘allow_other’ mount option regardless of whether ‘user_allow_other’ is set in the fuse configuration. An attacker may use this flaw to mount a FUSE file system, accessible by other users, and trick them into accessing files on that file system, possibly causing Denial of Service or other unspecified effects.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11044" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11044</a><br>Pivotal Apps Manager included in Pivotal Application Service, versions 2.2.x prior to 2.2.1 and 2.1.x prior to 2.1.8 and 2.0.x prior to 2.0.17 and 1.12.x prior to 1.12.26, does not escape all user-provided content when sending invitation emails.

Refresh tokens by design have a longer expiration time than access tokens, allowing the possessor of a refresh token to authenticate longer than expected. This affects the administrative endpoints of the UAA. i.e. /Users, /Groups, etc. However, if the user has been deleted or had groups removed, or the client was deleted, the refresh token will no longer be valid.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11059" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11059</a><br>RSA Archer, versions prior to 6.4.0.1, contain a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.
