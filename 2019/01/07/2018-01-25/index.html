An attacker with permission to commit to a repository linked in Sourcetree for macOS is able to exploit this issue to gain code execution on the system. From version 1.4.0 of Sourcetree for macOS, this vulnerability can be triggered from a webpage through the use of the Sourcetree URI handler. Versions of Sourcetree for macOS starting with 1.0b2 before version 2.7.0 are affected by this vulnerability.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14593" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-14593</a><br>Sourcetree for Windows had several argument and command injection bugs in Mercurial and Git repository handling.

The form validation AJAX requests were sent via GET, which could result in secrets being logged to a HTTP access log in non-default configurations of Jenkins, and made available to users with access to these log files. Form validation for &lt;f:password/&gt; is now always sent via POST, which is typically not logged.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1000402" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-1000402</a><br>Jenkins Swarm Plugin Client 3.4 and earlier bundled a version of the commons-httpclient library with the vulnerability CVE-2012-6153 that incorrectly verified SSL certificates, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1000403" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-1000403</a><br>Jenkins Speaks!
