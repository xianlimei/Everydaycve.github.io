Confidential information such as password hashes (/etc/shadow) or other secrets (such as log files or private keys) can be leaked to the attacker. The vulnerability has a confidentiality impact, but has no direct impact on system integrity or availability.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11320" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11320</a><br>In Octopus Deploy 2018.4.4 through 2018.5.1, Octopus variables that are sourced from the target do not have sensitive values obfuscated in the deployment logs.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11330" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11330</a><br>An issue was discovered in Pluck before 4.7.6.

Jenkins allows plugins to annotate build logs, adding new content or changing the presentation of existing content while the build is running. Malicious Jenkins users, or users with SCM access, could configure jobs or modify build scripts such that they print serialized console notes that perform cross-site scripting attacks on Jenkins users viewing the build logs.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1067" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1067</a><br>In Undertow before versions 7.1.2.CR1, 7.1.2.GA it was found that the fix for CVE-2016-4993 was incomplete and Undertow web server is vulnerable to the injection of arbitrary HTTP headers, and also response splitting, due to insufficient sanitization and validation of user input before the input is used as part of an HTTP header value.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-1108</a><br>kernel drivers before version 4.17-rc1 are vulnerable to a weakness in the Linux kernel’s implementation of random seed data. Programs, early in the boot sequence, could use the data allocated for the seed before it was sufficiently generated.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8010" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-8010</a><br>This vulnerability in Apache Solr 6.0.0 to 6.6.3, 7.0.0 to 7.3.0 relates to an XML external entity expansion (XXE) in Solr config files (solrconfig.xml, schema.xml, managed-schema). In addition, Xinclude functionality provided in these config files is also affected in a similar way. The vulnerability can be used as XXE using file/ftp/http protocols in order to read arbitrary local files from the Solr server or the internal network. Users are advised to upgrade to either Solr 6.6.4 or Solr 7.3.1 releases both of which address the vulnerability. Once upgrade is complete, no other steps are required. Those releases only allow external entities and Xincludes that refer to local files / zookeeper resources below the Solr instance directory (using Solr’s ResourceLoader); usage of absolute URLs is denied. Keep in mind, that external entities and XInclude are explicitly supported to better structure config files in large installations. Before Solr 6 this was no problem, as config files were not accessible through the APIs.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8012" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-8012</a><br>No authentication/authorization is enforced when a server attempts to join a quorum in Apache ZooKeeper before 3.4.10, and 3.5.0-alpha through 3.5.3-beta.

This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2018-1035.</p>
