Successful exploitation will enable an attacker to disable/enable all monitoring for a particular host or disable/enable monitoring for a specific service.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14620" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14620</a><br>The OpenStack RabbitMQ container image insecurely retrieves the rabbitmq_clusterer component over HTTP during the build stage. This could potentially allow an attacker to serve malicious code to the image builder and install in the resultant container image. Version of openstack-rabbitmq-container and openstack-containers as shipped with Red Hat Openstack 12, 13, 14 are believed to be vulnerable.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14625" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14625</a><br>A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel where an attacker may be able to have an uncontrolled read to kernel-memory from within a vm guest. A race condition between connect() and close() function may allow an attacker using the AF_VSOCK protocol to gather a 4 byte information leak or possibly intercept or corrupt AF_VSOCK messages destined to other clients.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14635" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14635</a><br>When using the Linux bridge ml2 driver, non-privileged tenants are able to create and attach ports without specifying an IP address, bypassing IP address validation. A potential denial of service could occur if an IP address, conflicting with existing guests or routers, is then assigned from outside of the allowed allocation pool. Versions of openstack-neutron before 13.0.0.0b2, 12.0.3 and 11.0.5 are vulnerable.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14636" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-14636</a><br>Live-migrated instances are briefly able to inspect traffic for other instances on the same hypervisor. This brief window could be extended indefinitely if the instance’s port is set administratively down prior to live-migration and kept down after the migration is complete. This is possible due to the Open vSwitch integration bridge being connected to the instance during migration. When connected to the integration bridge, all traffic for instances using the same Open vSwitch instance would potentially be visible to the migrated guest, as the required Open vSwitch VLAN filters are only applied post-migration. Versions of openstack-neutron before 13.0.0.0b2, 12.0.3, 11.0.5 are vulnerable.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15886" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-15886</a><br>Monstra CMS 3.0.4 does not properly restrict modified Snippet content, as demonstrated by the admin/index.php?id=snippets&amp;action=edit_snippet&amp;filename=google-analytics URI, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by placing this code after a &lt;?php substring.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12608" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-12608</a><br>An issue was discovered in Docker Moby before 17.06.0. The Docker engine validated a client TLS certificate using both the configured client CA root certificate and all system roots on non-Windows systems.
