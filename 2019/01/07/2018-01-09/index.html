If the client did not consume these updates, VNC server allocates growing memory to hold onto this data. A malicious remote VNC client could use this flaw to cause DoS to the server host.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15129" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-15129</a><br>A use-after-free vulnerability was found in network namespaces code affecting the Linux kernel before 4.14.11.
