This affects one or more threads and conversely one or more running processes running on the system. Once this occurs, the high CPU event(s) affects either or both the forwarding and control plane. As a result of this condition the device can become inaccessible in either or both the control and forwarding plane and stops forwarding traffic until the device is rebooted. The issue will reoccur after reboot upon receiving further transit traffic. Score: 5.7 MEDIUM (CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) For network designs utilizing layer 3 forwarding agents or other ARP through layer 3 technologies, the score is slightly higher.
