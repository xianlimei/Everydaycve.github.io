A remote authenticated malicious RSA NetWitness Server user with an Admin or Operator role could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the server with root privileges.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11065" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11065</a><br>The WorkPoint component, which is embedded in all RSA Archer, versions 6.1.x, 6.2.x, 6.3.x prior to 6.3.0.7 and 6.4.x prior to 6.4.0.1, contains a SQL injection vulnerability. A malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability to execute SQL commands on the back-end database to read certain data. Embedded WorkPoint is upgraded to version 4.10.16, which contains a fix for the vulnerability.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11502" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-11502</a><br>An issue was discovered in the Moderator Log Notes plugin 1.1 for MyBB.
