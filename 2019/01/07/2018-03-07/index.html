While The user does not inherit any of the other users privileges, they are able to view the previous screen. In this case it is possible that the user can see another users events or configuration information for whatever view is currently showing.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-5452</a><br>A Stack-based Buffer Overflow issue was discovered in Emerson Process Management ControlWave Micro Process Automation Controller: ControlWave Micro [ProConOS v.4.01.280] firmware: CWM v.05.78.00 and prior.
