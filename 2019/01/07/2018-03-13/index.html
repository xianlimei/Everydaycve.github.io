The original domain for the Concourse CI (concourse-dot-ci) open source project has been registered by an unknown actor, and is therefore no longer the official website for Concourse CI. The new official domain is concourse-ci.org. At approximately 4 am EDT on March 7, 2018 the Concourse OSS team began receiving reports that the Concourse domain was not responding. The Concourse OSS team discovered, upon investigation with both the original and the new domain registrars, that the originating domain registrar had made the domain available for purchase. This was done despite the domain being renewed by the Concourse OSS team through August 2018. For a customer to be affected, they would have needed to access a download from a “concourse-dot-ci” domain web site after March 6, 2018 18:00:00 EST. Accessing that domain is NOT recommended by Pivotal. Anyone who had been using that domain should immediately begin using the concourse-ci.org domain instead. Customers can also safely access Concourse software from the traditionally available locations on the Pivotal Network or GitHub.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7405" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-7405</a><br>Cross-site scripting (XSS) in Zoho ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer before 11.12 Build 11120 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.</p>
