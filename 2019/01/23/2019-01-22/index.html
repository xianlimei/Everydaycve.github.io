<p><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-6260" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-6260</a><br>The ASPEED ast2400 and ast2500 Baseband Management Controller (BMC) hardware and firmware implement Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB) bridges, which allow arbitrary read and write access to the BMC’s physical address space from the host (or from the network in unusual cases where the BMC console uart is attached to a serial concentrator). This CVE applies to the specific cases of iLPC2AHB bridge Pt I, iLPC2AHB bridge Pt II, PCIe VGA P2A bridge, DMA from/to arbitrary BMC memory via X-DMA, UART-based SoC Debug interface, LPC2AHB bridge, PCIe BMC P2A bridge, and Watchdog setup.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6922" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-6922</a><br>In Drupal core 8.x prior to 8.3.4 and Drupal core 7.x prior to 7.56; Private files that have been uploaded by an anonymous user but not permanently attached to content on the site should only be visible to the anonymous user that uploaded them, rather than all anonymous users. Drupal core did not previously provide this protection, allowing an access bypass vulnerability to occur. This issue is mitigated by the fact that in order to be affected, the site must allow anonymous users to upload files into a private file system.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6923" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2017-6923</a><br>In Drupal 8.x prior to 8.3.7 When creating a view, you can optionally use Ajax to update the displayed data via filter parameters. The views subsystem/module did not restrict access to the Ajax endpoint to only views configured to use Ajax. This is mitigated if you have access restrictions on the view. It is best practice to always include some form of access restrictions on all views, even if you are using another module to display them.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-19013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-19013</a><br>An attacker could inject commands to delete files and/or delete the contents of a file on CX-Supervisor (Versions 3.42 and prior) through a specially crafted project file.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-19017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2018-19017</a><br>Several use after free vulnerabilities have been identified in CX-Supervisor (Versions 3.42 and prior).

Some Drupal code (core, contrib, and custom) may be performing file operations on insufficiently validated user input, thereby being exposed to this vulnerability. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that such code paths typically require access to an administrative permission or an atypical configuration.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-6502" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-6502</a><br>sc_context_create in ctx.c in libopensc in OpenSC 0.19.0 has a memory leak, as demonstrated by a call from eidenv.<br><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-6503" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-6503</a><br>There is a deserialization vulnerability in Chatopera cosin v3.10.0.
